Core defines the basics and commons functions.\n    - all stats are grabbed through plugins (see the glances/plugins source folder).\n    - also outputs methods (Curse, Web mode, CSV) are managed as plugins.\n\n    The Curse interface is almost the same than the version 1.7. Some improvements have been made:\n    - space optimisation for the CPU, LOAD and MEM stats (justified alignment)\n    - CPU:\n        . CPU stats are displayed as soon as Glances is started\n        . steal CPU alerts are no more logged\n    - LOAD:\n        . 5 min LOAD alerts are no more logged\n    - File System:\n        . Display the device name (if space is available)\n    - Sensors:\n        . Sensors and HDD temperature are displayed in the same block\n    - Process list:\n        . Refactor columns: CPU%, MEM%, VIRT, RES, PID, USER, NICE, STATUS, TIME, IO, Command/name\n        . The running processes status is highlighted\n        . The process name is highlighted in the command line\n\n    Glances 2.0 brings a brand new Web Interface. You can run Glances in Web server mode and\n    consult the stats directly from a standard Web Browser.\n\n    The client mode can now fallback to a simple SNMP mode if Glances server is not found on the remote machine.\n\n    Complete release notes:\n    * Cut ifName and DiskName if they are too long in the curses interface (by Nicolargo)\n    * Windows CLI is OK but early experimental (by Nicolargo)\n    * Add bitrate limits to the networks interfaces (by Nicolargo)\n    * Batteries % stats are now in the sensors list (by Nicolargo)\n    * Refactor the client/server password security:

Core defines the basics and commons functions.\n    - all stats are grabbed through plugins (see the glances/plugins source folder).\n    - also outputs methods (Curse, Web mode, CSV) are managed as plugins.\n\n    The Curse interface is almost the same than the version 1.7. Some improvements have been made:\n    - space optimisation for the CPU, LOAD and MEM stats (justified alignment)\n    - CPU:\n        . CPU stats are displayed as soon as Glances is started\n        . steal CPU alerts are no more logged\n    - LOAD:\n        . 5 min LOAD alerts are no more logged\n    - File System:\n        . Display the device name (if space is available)\n    - Sensors:\n        . Sensors and HDD temperature are displayed in the same block\n    - Process list:\n        . Refactor columns: CPU%, MEM%, VIRT, RES, PID, USER, NICE, STATUS, TIME, IO, Command/name\n        . The running processes status is highlighted\n        . The process name is highlighted in the command line\n\n    Glances 2.0 brings a brand new Web Interface. You can run Glances in Web server mode and\n    consult the stats directly from a standard Web Browser.\n\n    The client mode can now fallback to a simple SNMP mode if Glances server is not found on the remote machine.\n\n    Complete release notes:\n    * Cut ifName and DiskName if they are too long in the curses interface (by Nicolargo)\n    * Windows CLI is OK but early experimental (by Nicolargo)\n    * Add bitrate limits to the networks interfaces (by Nicolargo)\n    * Batteries % stats are now in the sensors list (by Nicolargo)\n    * Refactor the client/server password security:
