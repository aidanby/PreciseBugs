removed mmap_limit, we now always use windows ... reduces VM use hugely,\n  because mmap windows are freed when their regions are freed, while images\n  are only unmapped when they are closed\n- have a min bytes for mmap windows as well, so we don't make too many tiny\n  windows\n- im_disp2Lab() was broken\n- deprecated.h is now defined in terms of current functionality, rather than\n  repeating stuff\n- im_flood() and friends rewritten, typically 4x faster\n- removed --with-cimg option, added --disable-cxx\n- added im_system_image() (thanks Roland)\n- added postclose callbacks\n- added

small updates to im_convf() from im_conv()\n- im_read_imask() produced an incorrect error message if passed a doublemask\n- rename im_convf(), im_convsepf() as _f()\n- vips.c drops _f suffix when overloading\n- regenerate C++ binding, don't make deprecated package\n\n9/11/09 started 7.20.0\n- removed vips-7.x.spec.in, shouldn't really have this in SVN\n- bumped version to 7.20\n- fixes to get \"make dist\" working again\n\n3/4/09 started 7.19.0\n- version bump\n- tiny conv speedup\n- catch lcms error messages\n- fix includes for gtk+-3.0\n- report virtual memory too in im__print_all()\n- cosmetic changes to nohalo\n- im_magick2vips() needs to invert alpha\n- now (more or less) passes -Wextra\n- added \"fail\" option to im_jpeg2vips: fail with an error on any warning\n  (thank you Ole)\n- started gtk-doc changes\n- renamed im_meta_get_type() and im_header_get_type() as\n  im_meta_get_typeof() and im_header_get_typeof() to prevent confusion with\n  GObject type definers (was breaking gtkdoc object scan)\n- revised more names, limited documented API\n- im_buildlut() could segv for non-zero based tables (thanks Jack)\n- VIPS_BUF_STATIC() does not take length arg\n- check for SetImageOption() so we work with GraphicsMagick too\n- \"header\" sets a non-zero exit code if anything failed\n- add and use im_check_uncoded() and friends\n- matlab load handles column-major and plane-separated images (thanks Mikhail)\n- JPEG save allows \"none\" for profile, meaning don't attach a profile\n- saner, simpler, faster typecasting for im_add(), im_subtract(),\n  im_multiply(), im_divide(), im_remainder()\n- im_remainder() has a float result for float types\n- im_measure() allows sel == NULL, meaning all patches\n- added \"deprecated\" package\n- faster, simpler, better im_max(), im_min, im_avg(), im_deviate()\n- im_max() returns true modulus, not square of modulus, for complex images\n- im_avg() works for complex, returning average modulus\n- im_system() fix (thanks Roland)\n- im_system() rewrite\n- im_maxpos()/im_minpos() are partial and work for complex\n- im_max()/im_min() are now convenience functions\n- im_maxpos_avg() handles complex and multi-band images\n- added im_point(), rewrite im_point_bilinear() in terms of this\n- close callbacks now happen *after* images have closed resources (such as\n  open files) ... this lets them delete temps and stuff. Expect breakage :(\n- added vips_interpolate_get_window_offset()\n- boolean revised: smaller, more general, faster\n- im_remainderconst_vec() renamed to im_remainder_vec() for consistency\n- added

on 64-bit machines with >2gb images and inplace ops\n  (thanks Christoph)\n- im_generate() checks that im_demand_hint() has been called for this image\n- im_jpeg2vips.c, set scale_num on shrink (thanks Guido)\n- heh argh reading history always stopped after the first line (thanks Haida)\n- added im_histindexed\n- new im_iterate() calls start and stop functions from workers so resources\n  they make are owned by the worker thread ... this makes it possible to have\n  start functions which create mutiple regions and therefore allows\n  im_iterate() to scan more than one image at once\n- threadgroup no longer has any default action, you must attach a work\n  function\n- added im_copy_file()\n- added im_insertset()\n- im_insertplace() allows small to be outside big\n- added im__colour_difference(), colour ops now work on any image format\n- added im_col_display_get_table(), so display tables are now shared by name\n- added im__colour_unary()\n- drop \"set\" postfix from

im_header_as_string()\n- im_malloc()/im_free() now call g_try_malloc()/g_free() ... removes confusion\n  over whether to use im_free() or g_free() for things like im_header_string()\n- added im_history_get(), im_getexp(), im_printdesc() as wrapped functions ...\n  so you no longer need the \"header\" program\n- image vectors from Python work, woo\n\n25/3/09 started 7.18.0\n- revised

cosmetic changes to nohalo\n- im_magick2vips() needs to invert alpha\n- now (more or less) passes -Wextra\n- added \"fail\" option to im_jpeg2vips: fail with an error on any warning\n  (thank you Ole)\n- started gtk-doc changes\n- renamed im_meta_get_type() and im_header_get_type() as\n  im_meta_get_typeof() and im_header_get_typeof() to prevent confusion with\n  GObject type definers (was breaking gtkdoc object scan)\n- revised more names, limited documented API\n- im_buildlut() could segv for non-zero based tables (thanks Jack)\n- VIPS_BUF_STATIC() does not take length arg\n- check for SetImageOption() so we work with GraphicsMagick too\n- \"header\" sets a non-zero exit code if anything failed\n- add and use im_check_uncoded() and friends\n- matlab load handles column-major and plane-separated images (thanks Mikhail)\n- JPEG save allows \"none\" for profile, meaning don't attach a profile\n- saner, simpler, faster typecasting for im_add(), im_subtract(),\n  im_multiply(), im_divide(), im_remainder()\n- im_remainder() has a float result for float types\n- im_measure() allows sel == NULL, meaning all patches\n- added \"deprecated\" package\n- faster, simpler, better im_max(), im_min, im_avg(), im_deviate()\n- im_max() returns true modulus, not square of modulus, for complex images\n- im_avg() works for complex, returning average modulus\n- im_system() fix (thanks Roland)\n- im_system() rewrite\n- im_maxpos()/im_minpos() are partial and work for complex\n- im_max()/im_min() are now convenience functions\n- im_maxpos_avg() handles complex and multi-band images\n- added im_point(), rewrite im_point_bilinear() in terms of this\n- close callbacks now happen *after* images have closed resources (such as\n  open files) ... this lets them delete temps and stuff. Expect breakage :(\n- added vips_interpolate_get_window_offset()\n- boolean revised: smaller, more general, faster\n- im_remainderconst_vec() renamed to im_remainder_vec() for consistency\n- added im_shift*_vec()\n- renamed im_eor_vec() as im_eorimage_vec() for consistency, also and, or\n- renamed im_eorconst() as im_eorimage_const() for consistency, also and, or\n- relational revised: smaller, more general, faster\n- im_blend()/im_ifthenelse() allows many-band conditional, 1-band then/else\n- im_blend()/im_ifthenelse() allows band and format to differ between then\n  and else parts\n- better im_check() functions\n- added im_flood_other() as start of simple segmentation operator\n- added im_label_regions()\n- im_printlines(), im_debugim() deprecated (use im_vips2csv() instead)\n-

on 64-bit machines with >2gb images and inplace ops\n  (thanks Christoph)\n- im_generate() checks that im_demand_hint() has been called for this image\n- im_jpeg2vips.c, set scale_num on shrink (thanks Guido)\n- heh argh reading history always stopped after the first line (thanks Haida)\n- added im_histindexed\n- new im_iterate() calls start and stop functions from workers so resources\n  they make are owned by the worker thread ... this makes it possible to have\n  start functions which create mutiple regions and therefore allows\n  im_iterate() to scan more than one image at once\n- threadgroup no longer has any default action, you must attach a work\n  function\n- added im_copy_file()\n- added im_insertset()\n- im_insertplace() allows small to be outside big\n- added im__colour_difference(), colour ops now work on any image format\n- added im_col_display_get_table(), so display tables are now shared by name\n- added im__colour_unary()\n- drop \"set\" postfix from names, so \"insert\" can now take a vector of positions\n- deprecate all the \"_raw\" variants, not really necessary now\n- removed \"contrib\", not very useful anymore\n- added im_header_as_string()\n- im_malloc()/im_free() now call g_try_malloc()/g_free() ... removes confusion\n  over whether to use im_free() or g_free() for things like im_header_string()\n- added im_history_get(), im_getexp(), im_printdesc() as wrapped functions ...\n  so you no longer need the \"header\" program\n- image vectors from Python work, woo\n\n25/3/09 started 7.18.0\n- revised
