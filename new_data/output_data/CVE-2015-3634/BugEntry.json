Install Slideshow either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.\n\n2. After activating Slideshow, click on 'Slideshows' and create a new slideshow.\n\n3. Click on 'Insert Image Slide' to insert an image slide, a popup will appear where you can search for the desired\nimage. Insert the image by clicking 'Insert'. The same goes for text and video slides, don't forget to save!\n\n4. Go to a post or a page and click the 'Insert Slideshow' button above the editor. A popup appears where you can select\nyour newly created slideshow to insert. You can also use the shortcode or code snippet visible in your slideshow admin\npanel to deploy your slideshow anywhere on your website. Use the widget to show any of your slideshows in the sidebar\nof your website.\n\n5. Feel like a sir.\n\n\n== Frequently Asked Questions ==\n\n= How do I add image slides? =\n\nClick the 'Image slide' button in the 'Slides List' of the slideshow. A screen will pop up where you'll be able to\nsearch though all images that have already been uploaded to your WordPress website. If you want to add new images to the\nslideshow, or you do not have any images yet, you'll have to upload them to the WordPress media page first.\n\n= How do I change a slideshow's settings? =\n\nJust like the posts and pages you're already familiar with, slideshows can be edited. Go to the 'Slideshows' tab in your\nWordPress admin, and you'll see a list of slideshows. If you have not created a slideshow yet, you can do so by clicking\n'Add new' on that same page. If there are slideshows in the list, click on the title of the slideshow you want to change\nthe settings of. On the slideshow's edit page you'll be able to find a box titled 'Slideshow Settings', in this box you\ncan change the slideshow's settings.\n\nIf you're creating multiple slideshows that should have the same settings, but their settings need to be different from\nthe default settings, you can change the default settings by going to the 'General Settings' page and clicking on the\n'Default Slideshow Settings' tab. Newly created slideshows will start off with the settings you set there.\n\n= How do I customize the slideshow's style? =\n\nOn your WordPress admin page, go to the 'Slideshows' menu item and click on 'General Settings', then go to the\n'Custom styles' tab. Here you'll see a list of default stylesheets, such as 'Light' and 'Dark', and a list of custom\nstylesheets; The ones you created.\n\nChoose a default stylesheet you'd like to customize and click 'Customize' to open the 'Custom style editor'. When\nyou're done editing click 'Save Changes' and go to the slideshow you'd like to style with the newly created stylesheet.\nIn the 'Slideshow Style' box you can now find and select your custom stylesheet. You can set a stylesheet for multiple\nslideshows.\n\nIf you've already created a custom stylesheet, you can edit it by clicking 'Edit'. You can also delete it by clicking\n'Delete'. Be careful with this though, a deleted stylesheet cannot be retrieved and cannot be used by any slideshow\nanymore.\n\n= Some users can add, edit or delete slideshows, although I do not want them to. Can I prevent this from happening? =\n\nYes you can. On your WordPress admin page, go to the 'Slideshows' menu item and click on 'General Settings', then go to\nthe 'User Capabilities' tab (If you're not already there). The privileges that allow user groups to perform certain\nactions are listed here. To allow, for instance, a contributor to add a slideshow, click the box in front of 'Contributor'\nto grant him the right to add slideshows.\n\nNote that when you grant someone the right to add or delete a slideshow, you'll also automatically grant him or her the\nright to edit slideshows, as this right is required to add or delete slideshows. The same is true for the reversed\nsituation.\n\n= The slideshow does not show up =\n\n- The slideshow is mostly called after the `</head>` tag, which means the scripts and stylesheet need to load in the footer\nof the website. A theme that has no `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` call in it's footer will not be able to load the slideshow's\nscripts.\n\n- Often when the slideshow isn't showing, there's a javascript error somewhere on the page and this error has caused\njavascript to break. For the slideshow to work again, this error needs to be fixed. Check if any errors were thrown by\nopening Google Chrome or Firefox (with Firebug installed) and press the 'F12' key. Errors show in the console tab.\n\n= Why does Internet Explorer show a big blank space above the slideshow? =\n\nInternet Explorer is a very strict browser, so when a big blank space above your slideshow is showing your page may\ncontain some invalid HTML. Most times invalid HTML is caused by placing the slideshow's shortcode or PHP snippet into\nan anchor tag (`<a></a>`) or paragraph tag (`<p></p>`), while you can only place a slideshow within a 'div' element\n(`<div></div>`).\n\n\n== Screenshots ==\n\n1. Here's what a default slideshow can look like. Sit back, grab a beer, enjoy.\n\n2. Create a new slideshow. Slides and settings specific to this slideshow can be set here.\n\n3. If you haven't uploaded any images yet, you can do so on the WordPress media page.\n\n4. Click the 'Image Slide' button in the Slides List to search and pick images from the WordPress media page.\nClick 'Insert' to insert the image as slide.\n\n5. The images you selected are directly visible in your Slides List, don't forget to save!\n\n6. When you understand the basics of creating slideshows, you may want to go a little more in depth and have a look at\nthe General Settings page. As seen in the image above, privileges can be granted to user roles to give users the ability\nto add, edit or delete slideshows.\n\n7. Default slideshow settings can be edited here. Slideshows that are newly created, will start out with these options.\n\n8. Custom styles can be added and customized here. Custom styles can be used to style one or more slideshows to your own\npersonal taste.\n\n\n== Changelog ==\n\n= 2.2.22 =\n*   Compatible with WordPress 4.0.\n*\tDefault stylesheets are no longer dynamically loaded through admin-ajax.php.\n*\tFixed: An issue with admin-ajax.php when the frontend uses HTTP, while the backend uses HTTPS.

The\nuncompressed files can be compiled using [Prepros](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/), or [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/).\n\n\n== Installation ==\n\n1. Install Slideshow either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.\n\n2. After activating Slideshow, click on 'Slideshows' and create a new slideshow.\n\n3. Click on 'Insert Image Slide' to insert an image slide, a popup will appear where you can search for the desired\nimage. Insert the image by clicking 'Insert'. The same goes for text and video slides, don't forget to save!\n\n4. Go to a post or a page and click the 'Insert Slideshow' button above the editor. A popup appears where you can select\nyour newly created slideshow to insert. You can also use the shortcode or code snippet visible in your slideshow admin\npanel to deploy your slideshow anywhere on your website. Use the widget to show any of your slideshows in the sidebar\nof your website.\n\n5. Feel like a sir.\n\n\n== Frequently Asked Questions ==\n\n= How do I add image slides? =\n\nClick the 'Image slide' button in the 'Slides List' of the slideshow. A screen will pop up where you'll be able to\nsearch though all images that have already been uploaded to your WordPress website. If you want to add new images to the\nslideshow, or you do not have any images yet, you'll have to upload them to the WordPress media page first.\n\n= How do I change a slideshow's settings? =\n\nJust like the posts and pages you're already familiar with, slideshows can be edited. Go to the 'Slideshows' tab in your\nWordPress admin, and you'll see a list of slideshows. If you have not created a slideshow yet, you can do so by clicking\n'Add new' on that same page. If there are slideshows in the list, click on the title of the slideshow you want to change\nthe settings of. On the slideshow's edit page you'll be able to find a box titled 'Slideshow Settings', in this box you\ncan change the slideshow's settings.\n\nIf you're creating multiple slideshows that should have the same settings, but their settings need to be different from\nthe default settings, you can change the default settings by going to the 'General Settings' page and clicking on the\n'Default Slideshow Settings' tab. Newly created slideshows will start off with the settings you set there.\n\n= How do I customize the slideshow's style? =\n\nOn your WordPress admin page, go to the 'Slideshows' menu item and click on 'General Settings', then go to the\n'Custom styles' tab. Here you'll see a list of default stylesheets, such as 'Light' and 'Dark', and a list of custom\nstylesheets; The ones you created.\n\nChoose a default stylesheet you'd like to customize and click 'Customize' to open the 'Custom style editor'. When\nyou're done editing click 'Save Changes' and go to the slideshow you'd like to style with the newly created stylesheet.\nIn the 'Slideshow Style' box you can now find and select your custom stylesheet. You can set a stylesheet for multiple\nslideshows.\n\nIf you've already created a custom stylesheet, you can edit it by clicking 'Edit'. You can also delete it by clicking\n'Delete'. Be careful with this though, a deleted stylesheet cannot be retrieved and cannot be used by any slideshow\nanymore.\n\n= Some users can add, edit or delete slideshows, although I do not want them to. Can I prevent this from happening? =\n\nYes you can. On your WordPress admin page, go to the 'Slideshows' menu item and click on 'General Settings', then go to\nthe 'User Capabilities' tab (If you're not already there). The privileges that allow user groups to perform certain\nactions are listed here. To allow, for instance, a contributor to add a slideshow, click the box in front of 'Contributor'\nto grant him the right to add slideshows.\n\nNote that when you grant someone the right to add or delete a slideshow, you'll also automatically grant him or her the\nright to edit slideshows, as this right is required to add or delete slideshows. The same is true for the reversed\nsituation.\n\n= The slideshow does not show up =\n\n- The slideshow is mostly called after the `</head>` tag, which means the scripts and stylesheet need to load in the footer\nof the website. A theme that has no `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` call in it's footer will not be able to load the slideshow's\nscripts.\n\n- Often when the slideshow isn't showing, there's a javascript error somewhere on the page and this error has caused\njavascript to break. For the slideshow to work again, this error needs to be fixed. Check if any errors were thrown by\nopening Google Chrome or Firefox (with Firebug installed) and press the 'F12' key. Errors show in the console tab.\n\n= Why does Internet Explorer show a big blank space above the slideshow? =\n\nInternet Explorer is a very strict browser, so when a big blank space above your slideshow is showing your page may\ncontain some invalid HTML. Most times invalid HTML is caused by placing the slideshow's shortcode or PHP snippet into\nan anchor tag (`<a></a>`) or paragraph tag (`<p></p>`), while you can only place a slideshow within a 'div' element\n(`<div></div>`).\n\n\n== Screenshots ==\n\n1. Here's what a default slideshow can look like. Sit back, grab a beer, enjoy.\n\n2. Create a new slideshow. Slides and settings specific to this slideshow can be set here.\n\n3. If you haven't uploaded any images yet, you can do so on the WordPress media page.\n\n4. Click the 'Image Slide' button in the Slides List to search and pick images from the WordPress media page.\nClick 'Insert' to insert the image as slide.\n\n5. The images you selected are directly visible in your Slides List, don't forget to save!\n\n6. When you understand the basics of creating slideshows, you may want to go a little more in depth and have a look at\nthe General Settings page. As seen in the image above, privileges can be granted to user roles to give users the ability\nto add, edit or delete slideshows.\n\n7. Default slideshow settings can be edited here. Slideshows that are newly created, will start out with these options.\n\n8. Custom styles can be added and customized here. Custom styles can be used to style one or more slideshows to your own\npersonal taste.\n\n\n== Changelog ==\n\n= 2.2.22 =\n*   Compatible with WordPress 4.2.\n*\tDefault stylesheets are no longer dynamically loaded through admin-ajax.php.\n*\tFixed: Security vulnerability in the SlideshowPluginSlideshowStylesheet class.\n*\tFixed: An issue with admin-ajax.php when the frontend uses HTTP, while the backend uses HTTPS.
