Turn the different caching options on/off or set a default time-to-live for those items being cached.\n- [New feature] Database result-set and xPDO object caching, with support for memcache, native-JSON object caching for high-performance AJAX requests.\n- [New feature] Configurable session management with default implementation configured for modSessionHandler, an xPDO-based implementation that stores sessions in a database, and allows a great deal of configurability, by site and/or context.\n- [New feature] Contexts allows a site to be organized into sub-sites, subdomains, etc, and override any system settings by context.  The default contexts are 'web' and 'mgr' to support the legacy ideas of front-end and back-end session contexts.\n- Introducing the new MODx core built on top of xPDO; this will incrementally replace the entire existing codebase, but can co-exist until 1.0 release and provides about 90 to 95% legacy compatibility for existing tags and add-ons.\n", "<?php\n/**\n * modManagerRequest\n *\n * @package modx\n */\nrequire_once MODX_CORE_PATH .

The default contexts are 'web' and 'mgr' to support the legacy ideas of front-end and back-end session contexts.\n- Introducing the new MODx core built on top of xPDO; this will incrementally replace the entire existing codebase, but can co-exist until 1.0 release and provides about 90 to 95% legacy compatibility for existing tags and add-ons.\n", "<?php\n/**\n * modManagerRequest\n *\n * @package modx\n */\nrequire_once MODX_CORE_PATH .
