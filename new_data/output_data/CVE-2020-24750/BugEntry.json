working\n (reported by Nir S)\n(and all fixes from 1.9.7)\n\nImprovements:\n\n* [Issue#11]: Improve ObjectMapper.convertValue()/.treeToValue() to use\n  cast if possible\n\n2.0.1 [23-Apr-2012]\n\nFixes:\n\n* [JACKSON-827] Ensure core packages work on JDK 1.5\n (reported by Pascal g)\n* [JACKSON-829] Custom serializers not working for List<String> properties,\n  @JsonSerialize(contentUsing)\n (reported by James R)\n\nImprovements:\n\n* [Issue#5]: Add support for maps with java.util.Locale keys to the set of\n  StdKeyDeserializers\n (contributed by Ryan G)\n\n2.0.0 [25-Mar-2012]\n\nFixes:\n\n* [JACKSON-368]: Problems with managed references, abstract types\n* [JACKSON-711]: Delegating @JsonCreator did not work with Injectable values\n* [JACKSON-798]: Problem with external type id, creators\n  (reported by Casey L)\n(and all fixes up until and including 1.9.6)\n\nImprovements:\n\n* [JACKSON-546]: Indicate end-of-input with JsonMappingException instead\n  of EOFException, when there is no parsing exception\n* [JACKSON-664]: Reduce overhead of type resolution by adding caching\n  in TypeFactory\n* [JACKSON-690]: Pass DeserializationContext through ValueInstantiator\n* [JACKSON-695]: Add 'isEmpty(value)' in JsonSerializer to allow\n  customizing handling of serialization of empty values\n* [JACKSON-710]: 'ObjectMapper.convertValue()'

(MapperFeature, JsonFactory.Feature) an per\n  instance features (existing ones)\n* [JACKSON-732]: Allow 'AnnotationIntrospector.findContentDeserializer()'\n  (and similar) to return instance, not just Class<?> for instance\n (requested by James R)\n* [JACKSON-736]: Add (more) access to array, container and map serializers\n* [JACKSON-737]: Allow accessing of \"creator properties\" for BeanDeserializer\n* [JACKSON-748]: Add 'registerSubtypes' to 'Module.setupContext' (and SimpleModule)\n* [JACKSON-749]: Make @JsonValue work for Enum deserialization\n* [JACKSON-769]:

'DeserializationFeature'\n* [JACKSON-780]: MissingNode, NullNode should return 'defaultValue' from 'asXxx' methods,\n  (not 0 for numbers), as they are not numeric types\n* [JACKSON-787]: Allow use of @JsonIgnoreProperties for properties (fields, getters, setters)\n* [JACKSON-795]: @JsonValue was not working for Maps, Collections\n* [JACKSON-800]: Add

of JSON Views for deserialization\n* [JACKSON-636]: Add 'SerializationFeature.ORDER_MAP_ENTRIES_BY_KEYS' to allow\n  forced sorting of Maps during serialization\n  (suggested by Joern H)\n*
