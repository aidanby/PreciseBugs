Previously, whenever more than one pass was taken over\n  the packet, the packet contents would be dumped incorrectly (i.e.,\n  the output form -x would be wrong on little endian machines because\n  the protocol dumpers would modify the data).  Thanks to Charles Hannum\n  (mycroft@gnu.ai.mit.edu) for reporting this problem.\n\n- Added support for decnet protocol dumping thanks to Jeff Mogul\n  (mogul@pa.dec.com).\n\n- Fix bug that caused length of packet to be incorrectly printed\n  (off by ether header size) for unknown ethernet types thanks\n  to Greg Miller (gmiller@kayak.mitre.org).\n\n- Added support for IPX protocol dumping thanks to Brad Parker\n  (brad@fcr.com).\n\n- Added check to verify IP header checksum under -v thanks to\n  Brad Parker (brad@fcr.com).\n\n- Move packet capture code to new libpcap library (which is\n  packaged separately).\n\n- Prototype everything and assume an ansi compiler.\n\n- print-arp.c: Print hardware ethernet addresses if they're not\n  what we expect.\n\n- print-bootp.c: Decode the cmu vendor field. Add RFC1497 tags.\n  Many helpful suggestions from Gordon Ross (gwr@jericho.mc.com).\n\n- print-fddi.c: Improvements. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul\n  (mogul@pa.dec.com).\n\n- print-icmp.c: Byte swap netmask before printing. Thanks to\n  Richard Stevens (rstevens@noao.edu). Print icmp type when unknown.\n\n- print-ip.c: Print the inner ip datagram of ip-in-ip encapsulated packets.\n  By default, only the inner packet is dumped, appended with the token\n  \"(encap)\".  Under -v, both the inner and output packets are dumped\n  (on the same line).  Note that the filter applies to the original packet,\n  not the encapsulated packet.  So if you run tcpdump on a net with an\n  IP Multicast tunnel, you cannot filter out the datagrams using the\n  conventional syntax.  (You can filter away all the ip-in-ip traffic\n  with \"not ip proto 4\".)\n\n- print-nfs.c: Keep pending rpc's in circular table. Add generic\n  nfs header and remove os dependences. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul.\n\n- print-ospf.c: Improvements. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul.\n\n- tcpdump.c: Add -T flag allows interpretation of \"vat\", \"wb\", \"rpc\"\n  (sunrpc) and rtp packets.

For example, 'icmp[0] != 8 and icmp[0] != 0'\n  matches non-echo/reply ICMP packets.\n\n- Many improvements to filter code optimizer.\n\n- Added 'multicast' keyword and extended the 'broadcast' keyword can now be\n  so that protocol qualifications are allowed. For example, \"ip broadcast\"\n  and \"ether multicast\" are valid filters.\n\n- Added support for monitoring the loopback interface (i.e. 'tcpdump -i lo').\n  Jeffrey Honig (jch@MITCHELL.CIT.CORNELL.EDU) contributed the kernel\n  patches to netinet/if_loop.c.\n\n- Added support for the Ungermann-Bass Ethernet on IBM/PC-RTs running AOS.\n  Contact Jeffrey Honig (jch@MITCHELL.CIT.CORNELL.EDU) for the diffs.\n\n- Added EGP and OSPF printers, thanks to Jeffrey Honig.\n\nv2.1 Tue Jan 28 11:00:14 PST 1992\n\n- Internal release (never publicly exported).\n\nv2.0.1 Sun Jan 26 21:10:10 PDT\n\n- Various byte ordering fixes.\n\n- Add truncation checks.\n\n- inet.c: Support BSD style SIOCGIFCONF.\n\n- nametoaddr.c: Handle multi addresses for single host.\n\n- optimize.c: Rewritten.\n\n- pcap-bpf.c: don't choke when we get ptraced. only set promiscuous\n  for broadcast nets.\n\n- print-atal.c: Fix an alignment bug (thanks to\n  stanonik@nprdc.navy.mil) Add missing printf() argument.\n\n- print-bootp.c: First attempt at decoding the vendor buffer.\n\n- print-domain.c: Fix truncation checks.\n\n- print-icmp.c: Calculate length of packets from the ip header.\n\n- print-ip.c: Print frag id in decimal (so it's easier to match up\n  with non-frags). Add support for ospf, egp and igmp.\n\n- print-nfs.c: Lots of changes.\n\n- print-ntp.c: Make some verbose output depend on -v.\n\n- print-snmp.c: New version from John LoVerso.\n\n- print-tcp.c: Print rfc1072 tcp options.\n\n- tcpdump.c: Print \"0x\" prefix for %x formats. Always print 6 digits\n  (microseconds) worth of precision. Fix uid bugs.\n\n- A packet dumper has been added (thanks to Jeff Mogul of DECWRL).\n  With this option, you can create an architecture independent binary\n  trace file in real time, without the overhead of the packet printer.\n  At a later time, the packets can be filtered (again) and printed.\n\n- BSD is supported.  You must have BPF in your kernel.\n  Since the filtering is now done in the kernel, fewer packets are\n  dropped.  In fact, with BPF and the packet dumper option, a measly\n  Sun 3/50 can keep up with a busy network.\n\n- Compressed SLIP packets can now be dumped, provided you use our\n  SLIP software and BPF.  These packets are dumped as any other IP\n  packet; the compressed headers are dumped with the '-e' option.\n\n- Machines with little-endian byte ordering are supported (thanks to\n  Jeff Mogul).\n\n- Ultrix 4.0 is supported (also thanks to Jeff Mogul).\n\n- IBM RT and Stanford Enetfilter support has been added by\n  Rayan Zachariassen <rayan@canet.ca>.  Tcpdump has been tested under\n  both the vanilla Enetfilter interface, and the extended interface\n  (#ifdef'd by IBMRTPC) present in the MERIT version of the Enetfilter.\n\n- TFTP packets are now printed (requests only).\n\n- BOOTP packets are now printed.\n\n- SNMP packets are now printed. (thanks to John LoVerso of Xylogics).\n\n- Sparc architectures, including the Sparcstation-1, are now\n  supported thanks to Steve McCanne and Craig Leres.\n\n- SunOS 4 is now supported thanks to Micky Liu of Columbia\n  University (micky@cunixc.cc.columbia.edu).\n\n- IP options are now printed.\n\n- RIP packets are now printed.\n\n- There's a -v flag that prints out more information than the\n  default (e.g., it will enable printing of IP ttl, tos and id)\n  and -q flag that prints out less (e.g., it will disable\n  interpretation of AppleTalk-in-UDP).\n\n- The grammar has undergone substantial changes (if you have an\n  earlier version of tcpdump, you should re-read the manual\n  entry).\n\n  The most useful change is the addition of an expression\n  syntax that lets you filter on arbitrary fields or values in the\n  packet.  E.g., \"ip[0] > 0x45\" would print only packets with IP\n  options, \"tcp[13] & 3 != 0\" would print only TCP SYN and FIN\n  packets.\n\n  The most painful change is that concatenation no longer means\n  \"and\" -- e.g., you have to say \"host foo and port bar\" instead\n  of \"host foo port bar\".  The up side to this down is that\n  repeated qualifiers can be omitted, making most filter\n  expressions shorter.  E.g., you can now say \"ip host foo and\n  (bar or baz)\" to look at ip traffic between hosts foo and bar or\n  between hosts foo and baz.  [The old way of saying this was \"ip\n  host foo and (ip host bar or ip host baz)\".]\n\nv2.0 Sun Jan 13 12:20:40 PST 1991\n\n- Initial public release.\n"], "fixing_code": ["Monthday, Month DD, YYYY by gharris and denis\n  Summary for 5.0.0 tcpdump release (so far!)\n    Refine protocol decoding for:\n      EIGRP: Get the packet header fields right.\n      OpenFlow 1.0: Fix indentation of PORT_MOD.\n      RIP: Make a couple trivial protocol updates.\n      NetFlow: Use tcp_flag_values[] for TCP flags.\n      OSPF: Update to match the Router Properties registry.\n      MPLS: Rename the \"exp\" field to \"tc\".\n      VQP: Do not print unknown error codes twice.\n      ZMTP: Replace custom code with bittok2str().\n      BFD: Add support for S-BFD and spell LAG in uppercase.\n    User interface:\n      Add --print-sampling to print every Nth packet instead of all.\n    Source code:\n      Use %zu when printing a sizeof to squelch compiler warnings\n      (FIXME: somebody please wrap the line below just before the release)\n      AODV, AppleTalk, BOOTP, EGP, EIGRP, ForCES, Geneve, L2TP, NetFlow, NTP, OLSR, PGM, RIP, RSVP, SCTP, SNMP, TCP, UDP: Modernize packet parsing style\n      DCCP, EGP: Replace custom code with tok2str()\n      UDP: Clean up address and port printing.\n      AppleTalk: Declutter appletalk.h.\n      Introduce new ND_ICHECK*() macros to deduplicate more code.\n      IEEE 802.11: Simplify handle_action().\n      RPKI-Router: Refine length and bounds checks.\n    Building and testing:\n      Treat \"msys\" as Windows for test exit statuses.\n      Use unified diff by default.\n\nTBD\n  Summary for 4.99.2 tcpdump release: (so far)\n    Building and testing:\n      Handle some Autoconf/make errors better.\n      Fix \"make releasetar\" on AIX and Solaris.\n      Mend \"make check\" on Solaris 9 with Autoconf.\n      Address assorted compiler warnings.\n      Fix auto-enabling of Capsicum on FreeBSD with Autoconf.\n\nWednesday, June 9, 2021 by gharris\n  Summary for 4.99.1 tcpdump release\n    Source code:\n      Squelch some compiler warnings\n      ICMP: Update the snapend for some nested IP packets.\n      MACsec: Update the snapend thus the ICV field is not payload\n        for the caller.\n      EIGRP: Fix packet header fields\n      SMB: Disable printer by default in CMake builds\n      OLSR: Print the protocol name even if the packet is invalid\n      MSDP: Print \": \" before the protocol name\n      ESP: Remove padding, padding length and next header from the buffer\n      DHCPv6: Update the snapend for nested DHCPv6 packets\n      OpenFlow 1.0: Get snapend right for nested frames.\n      TCP: Update the snapend before decoding a MPTCP option\n      Ethernet, IEEE 802.15.4, IP, L2TP, TCP, ZEP: Add bounds checks\n      ForCES: Refine SPARSEDATA-TLV length check.\n      ASCII/hex: Use nd_trunc_longjmp() in truncation cases\n      GeoNet: Add a ND_TCHECK_LEN() call\n      Replace ND_TCHECK_/memcpy() pairs with GET_CPY_BYTES().\n      BGP: Fix overwrites of global 'astostr' temporary buffer\n      ARP: fix overwrites of static buffer in q922_string().\n      Frame Relay: have q922_string() handle errors better.\n    Building and testing:\n      Rebuild configure script when building release\n      Fix \"make clean\" for out-of-tree autotools builds\n      CMake: add stuff from CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to PKG_CONFIG_PATH.\n    Documentation:\n      man: Update a reference as www.cifs.org is gone.

Previously, whenever more than one pass was taken over\n  the packet, the packet contents would be dumped incorrectly (i.e.,\n  the output form -x would be wrong on little endian machines because\n  the protocol dumpers would modify the data).  Thanks to Charles Hannum\n  (mycroft@gnu.ai.mit.edu) for reporting this problem.\n\n- Added support for decnet protocol dumping thanks to Jeff Mogul\n  (mogul@pa.dec.com).\n\n- Fix bug that caused length of packet to be incorrectly printed\n  (off by ether header size) for unknown ethernet types thanks\n  to Greg Miller (gmiller@kayak.mitre.org).\n\n- Added support for IPX protocol dumping thanks to Brad Parker\n  (brad@fcr.com).\n\n- Added check to verify IP header checksum under -v thanks to\n  Brad Parker (brad@fcr.com).\n\n- Move packet capture code to new libpcap library (which is\n  packaged separately).\n\n- Prototype everything and assume an ansi compiler.\n\n- print-arp.c: Print hardware ethernet addresses if they're not\n  what we expect.\n\n- print-bootp.c: Decode the cmu vendor field. Add RFC1497 tags.\n  Many helpful suggestions from Gordon Ross (gwr@jericho.mc.com).\n\n- print-fddi.c: Improvements. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul\n  (mogul@pa.dec.com).\n\n- print-icmp.c: Byte swap netmask before printing. Thanks to\n  Richard Stevens (rstevens@noao.edu). Print icmp type when unknown.\n\n- print-ip.c: Print the inner ip datagram of ip-in-ip encapsulated packets.\n  By default, only the inner packet is dumped, appended with the token\n  \"(encap)\".  Under -v, both the inner and output packets are dumped\n  (on the same line).  Note that the filter applies to the original packet,\n  not the encapsulated packet.  So if you run tcpdump on a net with an\n  IP Multicast tunnel, you cannot filter out the datagrams using the\n  conventional syntax.  (You can filter away all the ip-in-ip traffic\n  with \"not ip proto 4\".)\n\n- print-nfs.c: Keep pending rpc's in circular table. Add generic\n  nfs header and remove os dependences. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul.\n\n- print-ospf.c: Improvements. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul.\n\n- tcpdump.c: Add -T flag allows interpretation of \"vat\", \"wb\", \"rpc\"\n  (sunrpc) and rtp packets. Added \"inbound\" and \"outbound\" keywords\n  Add && and || operators\n\nv2.2.1 Tue Jun 6 17:57:22 PDT 1992\n\n- Fix bug with -c flag.\n\nv2.2 Fri May 22 17:19:41 PDT 1992\n\n- savefile.c: Remove hack that shouldn't have been exported. Add\n  truncate checks.\n\n- Added the 'icmp' keyword.  For example, 'icmp[0] != 8 and icmp[0] != 0'\n  matches non-echo/reply ICMP packets.\n\n- Many improvements to filter code optimizer.\n\n- Added 'multicast' keyword and extended the 'broadcast' keyword can now be\n  so that protocol qualifications are allowed. For example, \"ip broadcast\"\n  and \"ether multicast\" are valid filters.\n\n- Added support for monitoring the loopback interface (i.e. 'tcpdump -i lo').\n  Jeffrey Honig (jch@MITCHELL.CIT.CORNELL.EDU) contributed the kernel\n  patches to netinet/if_loop.c.\n\n- Added support for the Ungermann-Bass Ethernet on IBM/PC-RTs running AOS.\n  Contact Jeffrey Honig (jch@MITCHELL.CIT.CORNELL.EDU) for the diffs.\n\n- Added EGP and OSPF printers, thanks to Jeffrey Honig.\n\nv2.1 Tue Jan 28 11:00:14 PST 1992\n\n- Internal release (never publicly exported).\n\nv2.0.1 Sun Jan 26 21:10:10 PDT\n\n- Various byte ordering fixes.\n\n- Add truncation checks.\n\n- inet.c: Support BSD style SIOCGIFCONF.\n\n- nametoaddr.c: Handle multi addresses for single host.\n\n- optimize.c: Rewritten.\n\n- pcap-bpf.c: don't choke when we get ptraced. only set promiscuous\n  for broadcast nets.\n\n- print-atal.c: Fix an alignment bug (thanks to\n  stanonik@nprdc.navy.mil) Add missing printf() argument.\n\n- print-bootp.c: First attempt at decoding the vendor buffer.\n\n- print-domain.c: Fix truncation checks.\n\n- print-icmp.c: Calculate length of packets from the ip header.\n\n- print-ip.c: Print frag id in decimal (so it's easier to match up\n  with non-frags). Add support for ospf, egp and igmp.\n\n- print-nfs.c: Lots of changes.\n\n- print-ntp.c: Make some verbose output depend on -v.\n\n- print-snmp.c: New version from John LoVerso.\n\n- print-tcp.c: Print rfc1072 tcp options.\n\n- tcpdump.c: Print \"0x\" prefix for %x formats. Always print 6 digits\n  (microseconds) worth of precision. Fix uid bugs.\n\n- A packet dumper has been added (thanks to Jeff Mogul of DECWRL).\n  With this option, you can create an architecture independent binary\n  trace file in real time, without the overhead of the packet printer.\n  At a later time, the packets can be filtered (again) and printed.\n\n- BSD is supported.  You must have BPF in your kernel.\n  Since the filtering is now done in the kernel, fewer packets are\n  dropped.  In fact, with BPF and the packet dumper option, a measly\n  Sun 3/50 can keep up with a busy network.\n\n- Compressed SLIP packets can now be dumped, provided you use our\n  SLIP software and BPF.  These packets are dumped as any other IP\n  packet; the compressed headers are dumped with the '-e' option.\n\n- Machines with little-endian byte ordering are supported (thanks to\n  Jeff Mogul).\n\n- Ultrix 4.0 is supported (also thanks to Jeff Mogul).\n\n- IBM RT and Stanford Enetfilter support has been added by\n  Rayan Zachariassen <rayan@canet.ca>.  Tcpdump has been tested under\n  both the vanilla Enetfilter interface, and the extended interface\n  (#ifdef'd by IBMRTPC) present in the MERIT version of the Enetfilter.\n\n- TFTP packets are now printed (requests only).\n\n- BOOTP packets are now printed.\n\n- SNMP packets are now printed. (thanks to John LoVerso of Xylogics).\n\n- Sparc architectures, including the Sparcstation-1, are now\n  supported thanks to Steve McCanne and Craig Leres.\n\n- SunOS 4 is now supported thanks to Micky Liu of Columbia\n  University (micky@cunixc.cc.columbia.edu).\n\n- IP options are now printed.\n\n- RIP packets are now printed.\n\n- There's a -v flag that prints out more information than the\n  default (e.g., it will enable printing of IP ttl, tos and id)\n  and -q flag that prints out less (e.g., it will disable\n  interpretation of AppleTalk-in-UDP).\n\n- The grammar has undergone substantial changes (if you have an\n  earlier version of tcpdump, you should re-read the manual\n  entry).\n\n  The most useful change is the addition of an expression\n  syntax that lets you filter on arbitrary fields or values in the\n  packet.  E.g., \"ip[0] > 0x45\" would print only packets with IP\n  options, \"tcp[13] & 3 != 0\" would print only TCP SYN and FIN\n  packets.\n\n  The most painful change is that concatenation no longer means\n  \"and\" -- e.g., you have to say \"host foo and port bar\" instead\n  of \"host foo port bar\".  The up side to this down is that\n  repeated qualifiers can be omitted, making most filter\n  expressions shorter.  E.g., you can now say \"ip host foo and\n  (bar or baz)\" to look at ip traffic between hosts foo and bar or\n  between hosts foo and baz.  [The old way of saying this was \"ip\n  host foo and (ip host bar or ip host baz)\".]\n\nv2.0 Sun Jan 13 12:20:40 PST 1991\n\n- Initial public release.\n"], "filenames": ["CHANGES"], "buggy_code_start_loc": [72], "buggy_code_end_loc": [72], "fixing_code_start_loc": [73], "fixing_code_end_loc": [74], "type": "CWE-120", "message": "The command-line argument parser in tcpdump before 4.99.0 has a buffer overflow in tcpdump.c:read_infile().
