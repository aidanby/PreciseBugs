The macros for man- and manual-pages are\n    now constructed under tmp/wip, so they can't conflict anymore with the\n    distribution macros which are constructed under tmp/install. The\n    xlatin1.bug was observed intermittently, making its fix kind of\n    difficult. \n\n  * Added the file icmake/README explaining the steps/elements of the macro\n    construction process.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 09 Oct 2013 12:47:12 +0200\n\nyodl (3.02.1)\n\n  * Repaired recurrent bug, fixed since yodl 2.14.4, about missing local-path\n    location specification in scripts/createmacros causing xlatin1.tex to be\n    included as ./xlatin1.tex.\n\n  * Modified Yodl's build script's 'build sf' mode\n\nyodl (3.02.0)\n\n  * Repaired failing `return to parent directory' after INCLUDEFILE\n    bug, intermittently observed th txt-files.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 21 May 2013 09:39:58 +0200\n\nyodl (3.01.0)\n\n  * Re-implemented l_chdir in src/lexer/lchdir.c and new_getcwd in\n    src/new/getcwd.c following compilation problems on GNU-hurd, as reported\n    by Svante Signell\n\n  * Yodl's build script now honors CFLAGS en LDFLAGS environment variables.\n\n  * Repaired some inconsistencies in the INSTALL.txt file\n\n  * The yodl2whatever script sets the path to the yodl binaries as configured\n    unless the YODL_BIN environment variable has been set, in which case that\n    environment variable' value is used as the path prefix when calling yodl\n    programs. \n\n  * Added 'build sf' to create the files to be uploaded to sourceforge. This\n    function is for Internal Use Only\n\n  * Renamed the 'sourceforge' directory to 'sf'\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 10 Mar 2013 12:37:45 +0100\n\nyodl (3.00.0)\n\n  * When including files the included file's directory path becomes the\n    cwd. This results in file-inclusion handling like C's #include directive.\n    Previously the cwd remained fixed, causing problems if the same \n    files are included for different documents where these included files\n    themselves also include files. The -L (--legacy-include) option can be\n    specified to prevent the change of working directory (and thus to revert\n    to the original handling of includefile specifications.\n\n  * The includefile macro no longer defines a label equal to its argument just\n    before the file is included. Instead the macro lincludefile can be used,\n    which provides more control of the label that is defined, if required. The\n    added benefit is a *much* smaller .idx file, resulting in faster\n    processing. \n\n  * The recognition of filenames no longer favors files without extensions\n    above files having the .yo extension. Files to be included are supposed to\n    have a .yo (=DEFAULT_EXT) extension (using (l)includefile), but the\n    extension does not have to be explicitly specified. Only if no file having\n    the DEFAULT_EXT is found the file is attempted as specified.\n\n  * Single-line functions whose addresses are not required are now inline\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 07 Nov 2010 17:18:05 +0100\n\nyodl (2.15.2)\n\n  * Added macro cellsline to set multiple horizontal lines in one table row.\n\n  * Bug fix in yodlverbinsert (confused markers provided as command-line\n    argument with markers to which additional characters were appended\n    appearing in scanned files).\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 12 Mar 2010 10:50:13 +0100\n\nyodl (2.15.1)\n\n  * Added a chartable translation to macros/yodl/chartables/man.tables.yo: in\n    man-pages the - character is by default interpreted as hyphen, not as\n    minus. The chartable now defines    '-' = \"\\\\-\"    turning - characters\n    into man-page minus characters. Forced hyphens can be written as \n    manpagecommand(\\CHAR(40)hy)\n\n  * Added scripts/hrefnotmpinstall (href no tmp/install) removing tmp/install\n    hyperlinks from html-version of the manual: given yodl.html, \n    the manual pages now link locally to each other.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 27 Jul 2009 11:32:35 +0200\n\nyodl (2.15.0)\n\n  * Detected a bug! Lines starting with + characters (like +NOTRANS, but also\n    \\'e since those constructions are substituded by +NOTRANS... sequences)\n    were not properly converted: the + appeared in the output. Caused by\n    p_handledefaultnewline, separating the + from its trailing chars. Repaired\n    by testing for an initial +, followed by adding what's trailing if found.\n\n  * The yodlbuiltin man-page (not appearing in the distribution) is now added.\n\n  * The subscript and superscript macro descriptions were improved.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 16 Jul 2009 22:38:57 +0200\n\nyodl (2.14.4)\n\n  * Missing local-path location specification in scripts/createmacros caused\n    xlatin1.tex to be included as ./xlatin1.tex. Now repaired.\n\n  * Yodl2whatever's --intermediate option didn't accept a (file) argument. Now\n    repaired. \n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 13 May 2009 11:38:42 +0200\n\nyodl (2.14.3)\n\n  * Tony Mancill and George Danchev discovered a flaw in the build script: it\n    used previously installed macro files. Now repaired: Installation should\n    run fine on a system not yet supporting Yodl.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 27 Apr 2009 20:56:33 +0200\n\nyodl (2.14.2)\n\n  * Yodl2whatever uses `eval' to call yodl. Without this --define options\n    are not properly recognized\n\n  * Build script completely rewritten\n\n  * Added striproff as the script `yodlstriproff', and renamed the manpage \n    accordingly\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 15 Apr 2009 19:58:05 +0200\n\nyodl (2.14.1)\n\n  * Build script allows separate construction of program, man pages and \n    manual, using the standard installation path or the binaries constructed\n    from the source package\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 21 Mar 2009 09:08:58 +0100\n\nyodl (2.14.0)\n\n  * Character tables now accept hexadecimal and octal constants in their\n    double quoted character redefinition strings.\n\n  * Double and single quotes appearing in man-page texts are now handled\n    properly: the double quote is set as \\(dq\\& and the single quote as \\(dq\\&\n\n  * All Yodl manual pages refer to all remaining Yodl manual pages\n\n  * Several warnings generated by cppcheck on `src/verbinsert.c' were\n    fixed. One remains, which turns out to be a cppcheck false positive.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 15 Mar 2009 13:11:08 +0100\n\nyodl (2.13.2)\n\n  * yodl2whatever did not remove intermediate files when no post processing\n    was required. Now repaired.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 24 Oct 2008 15:04:10 +0200\n\nyodl (2.13.1)\n\n  * yodl2whatever no longer supports the --unique-output and --path\n    option. Instead, communication between yodl and yodlpost is handled\n    through temporary files created by mktemp(1). The temporary files will be\n    removed following the yodl conversion. The yodl2whatever script offers the\n    --intermediate=filename option to allow users to keep the intermediate\n    files.\n\nyodl (2.12.2)\n\n  * TEMPORARY MODIFICATION: manual construction will not rebuild the yodl.pdf\n    file to circumvent a bug in ps2pdf on some architectures. The manual/pdf\n    directory will not be cleaned by `build clean'. To force the construction\n    of the yodl.pdf file call `build manual pdf' in the ./manual directory\n    immediately following the call of `build manual'.\n\nyodl (2.12.1)\n\n  * Introducing a subversion number: major.minor.subversion.\n\n  * yodlpost's `#define BLOCK_POSTQUEUE' is replaced by an `-l <size>' option,\n    by default using `-l 1000', allowing large(r) lines in index-files to be\n    processed. The old BLOCK_POSTQUEUE value was set at 500.\n \n  * All symbols starting with _ were renamed to symbols from which the _ was\n    removed.\n\n  * Repaired the [nl]subsubsect() macro that did not typeset a proper section \n    heading in html files. It does so now.\n\nyodl (2.11)\n\n  * repaired src/yodl/gramuppercase.c src/yodl/grampushmacro.c \n    src/yodl/gramdefinemacro.c in which addresses of\n    size_t variables were passed to functions expecting addresses of ints\n    comparable modifications to yodl/src/yodlpost/handlexmltocentry.c\n    yodl/src/yodlpost/handlehtmltocentry.c yodl/src/yodlpost/handlexmltoc.c\n    yodl/src/yodlpost/handletxttocentry.c\n  * The hm_pjw function in hashmap/hmpjw.c uses a different procedure to \n    determine the most significant nibble, producing the same hashvalues as\n    the previous version.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 12 Mar 2007 20:28:34 +0100\n\nyodl (2.10)\n\n  * repaired scores of compilation warnings in the sources detected by \n    Daniel Richard G. while compiling for the amd64.\n\n  * Changed the organization of the Stack: it now consists of unions, allowing\n    for cast-less storage and retrieval of various types. With it comes a\n    slight reorganization of the code: the Media struct, till now defined in\n    the lexer.ih file has its struct defined separately in src/mediastruct in\n    order to allow Stack access to it. See src/HIERARCHY for an overview.\n\n  * Moved l_media functions from lexer to new class Media, required for the\n    new Stack organization\n\n  * The src/build script contains #defines allowing extensive compilation\n    tests (as suggested by Daniel Richard G.) as well as compilations for\n    gprof, the GNU profiler. Running the profiler after building the yodl\n    manual shows that currenly no clear speedup-targets exist.\n\n  * The appendix() macro now creates html chapters starting at 1, as suggested\n    by Karel Kubat.\n\n  * The yodl2whatever script now handles versions of the getopt(1) program\n    that can't handle long options. They still can't be handled, but the\n    script now doesn't break. Long options defined for the script itself are\n    still recognized (--no-warnings, --tmp, --unique-output).\n\n  * Some systems (Notably: Mac OSX) apparently don't support the getline()\n    function, used in the verbinsert program. Verbinsert now contains its own\n    version: `y_getline()'\n\n  * Added the euro() macro setting the euro symbol.\n\n  * Removed the ./debian subdirectory which does not belong to the Yodl\n    package itself. The Debian packaging files can be obtained from, e.g.,\n    https://svn.openfmi.net/debian-addons-bg/yodl\n\n  * Changed unsigned into size_t where appropriate.\n\nyodl (2.04a)\n  * repaired <txt> definition of lchapter.raw, which put the label, rather \n    than the chapter's title in the document's contents.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 05 Sep 2006 16:32:08 +0200\n\nyodl (2.04)\n\n    From patches offered by Colin Watson:\n\n  * gcc's printf format checking features is used where available.\n  * Memory properly freed on error path in construct_tocentry.\n  * Reuse of va_list in string_vformat is fixed; the correct way to do this is\n    to va_copy it first, although this requires some care regarding\n    portability.\n  \n    Additional modification:\n\n  * The generic `yodl2whatever' has been given two more options to allow users\n    to prevent file-collisions when the same user calls yodl to process a\n    document while another invokation of yodl by that user is still running:\n\n    --tmp=<path>: By default, the temporary file is written in the /tmp\n                   directory. Specify an alternate directory using \n                   --tmp = path-to-alternate-tmp-directory\n    --unique-output: By default, yodl will use a temporary output file that \n                   is rewritten at each new yodl-invokation. If that's not \n                   what you want, specify the --unique-output flag, which\n                   will use the process-id as part of the temporary output\n                   file. This file is NOT removed when the yodl-conversion\n                   fails. \n\n    The yodl2whatever man-page is modified accordingly.\n\nyodl (2.03)\n\n  * Added the program `yodlverbinsert', placing the contents of a `labeled\n    section' from some text file (usually a C or C++ source) in a verb()\n    macro, writing the generated verb() command to the standard output stream.\n    Updated the user guide accordingly and added a manual page: `man\n    yodlverbinsert' gives details and examples.\n\nyodl (2.02) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Following suggestions by Karel Kubat, several data files were modified:\n    global variables are initialized to prevent compilation problems. Also,\n    Karel's contrib/build.pl script was modified by Karel. I changed the\n    initialization of the $config{TOPLEVEL_VERSION} so that it first tries to\n    read the current toplevel version from the src/config.h file, to promote\n    version synchronization.\n\n    Some minor changes to macro files were made, and several superfluous files\n    were removed from the distribution.\n\n    Adapted several debian-files, updating the standards and debhelper\n    versions, removed debian/ from the .orig archive and added an upstream\n    changelog file, keeping this file for future Debian changes only. The \n    initial version of the upstream-changelog file is this file: Yodl's\n    debian/changelog until (including) version 2.02.\n\n    Disregard the comment in version 2.01.03 about plans to discontinue\n    icmake. Icmake's build script will be kept and will remain to be yodl's \n    main build-tool. Many functions used in the src/build script have been\n    rebuilt, resulting in the removal of many system-function calls and thus\n    increasing its speed of execution.\n\n    Compilation warnings in src/subst/substaction.c and src/process/pparent.c\n    were solved.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 23 Aug 2006 10:42:12 +0200\n\nyodl (2.01.03) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * The XXtocclearpage symbol, used by the tocclearpage() and notocclearpage()\n    macros, was erroneously defined for the HTML convertor instead of the\n    LaTeX convertor. Also, the macro tocclearpage() did not assign a non-empty\n    value to the XXtocclearpage macro, so the macro had no effect.\n    \n    Added the file yodl/debian/compat\n    \n    Following suggestions by Karel Kubat, macros/rawmacros/footnote.raw was\n    modified for HTML-usage. With the HTML convertor a non-breakable space is\n    inserted before the (parenthesized) footnote-text.\n    \n    A `contrib' directory is created below /usr/share/doc/yodl. Currently it\n    contains a perl-script `build.pl' that may be used to create the\n    yodl-package. It is not maintained by me (Frank), but was supplied by\n    Karel Kubat. Note that it does not update the program version, but uses a\n    hard-coded version as set by the script. Karel (karel@e-tunity.com) should\n    be contacted for any questions related to this script. Furthermore, the\n    dependency on `icmake' will probably be removed from Yodl in the near\n    future: I'm planning to standardize the package building using a series of\n    generic shell-scripts, which may render the build.pl script obsolete as\n    well.\n    \n    The build-script will now install in yodl/yodl/debian/yodl instead of\n    yodl/yodl/debian/tmp\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 13 Mar 2006 20:53:23 +0100\n\nyodl (2.01.02) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Changed the lsect(), lsubsect(), lsubsubsect(), sect(), subsect() and\n    subsubsect() macros (for html and xml use) since the l...() macros set the\n    lastnumber value too late. New XX...sect[Counter].raw files were defined\n    to factorize common parts. The l...sect() macros now first set the next\n    section number, and then define a label. Finally the section code is\n    inserted. The ...sect() macros set the counter, followed by the section's\n    code. \n\n    Furthermore, added n-tilde and N-tilde definitions to chartables.\n\n    Note the change of my e-mail address: it's now @rug.nl, instead of\n    @rc.rug.nl\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 29 Jul 2005 14:38:57 +0200\n\nyodl (2.01.01) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Ai, another leftover from the previous bug-repair: if the suspected\n    macro call was already part of the set if supected macros calls the\n    already read open parentheses wasn't pushed back. It's now repaired.\n\n    Also, followed Karel's suggestion to do system(\"rm -rf bin/* libyodl.a\n    */o/*\"); in yodl/src/build, rather than just -f, in order to removed \n    any CVS directories that might be there as well. Since this part should\n    not contain any useful info for CVS it shouldn't matter that CVS is \n    removed. \n\n -- Frank B.

Repaired by\n    adding appropriate test\n\n    Repaired a bug in yodl itself:\n    -w flag eats initial openparen of parenthesized list. Not specifying -w\n    doesn't. Repaired by pushing back an open-parenthesis after recognizing a\n    suspected user macro which doesn't turn out to be a user macro in\n    src/parser/pnousermacro.c.

Work is needed on\n    compiler options for later versions.\n\n -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Sep 2003 08:23:03 +0100\n\nyodl (1.31.18-6) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Simply remove root-owned out/dummy.dep files in the clean target rather\n    than trying to chown them to $LOGNAME, which doesn't work under pbuilder\n    (closes: #189620).\n  * Use '%option noyywrap' rather than the messy local definition of\n    yywrap(), which doesn't build properly with current flex.\n  * Remove src/yodl2html-post/parser.c on clean to avoid bizarre build\n    failures (thanks, Daniel Schepler).\n\n -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  2 May 2003 09:21:08 +0100\n\nyodl (1.31.18-5) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Reinstate URL in control file, as it's useful for people browsing\n    http://packages.debian.org/ (thanks, Oohara Yuuma).\n  * Remove some cruft from debian/rules.\n  * Use dh_installinfo rather than the incorrect code in debian/postinst and\n    debian/prerm (which looked at /usr/info!).\n\n -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Nov 2002 20:34:34 +0000\n\nyodl (1.31.18-4) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Remove URL/authors from control file (should just be in copyright file).\n\n -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Jul 2002 00:37:11 +0100\n\nyodl (1.31.18-3) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Make startit() and endit() correctly generate <ul></ul> rather than\n    <dl></dl> (thanks, Frank B.

When those packages migrate to a different documentation system,\n    yodl may safely be removed.\n\n  * Unexport NAME in debian/rules; the Hurd sets it, which confuses stepmake\n    (closes: #111019, #111085).\n  * ' generates \\&' rather than \\' for groff -man output, as \\' is an acute\n    accent, not an apostrophe (thanks, Matt Kraai; closes: #51258).\n  * Recommend python rather than python1.5. yodl seems to work fine with\n    newer versions of python, and python1.5 wouldn't have worked because it\n    doesn't provide /usr/bin/python.\n  * Add build-dependencies.\n  * Policy version 3.2.1.\n\n -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Nov 2001 20:09:33 +0000\n\nyodl (1.31.18-1.1) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Non Maintainer Upload.\n  * Package is orphaned, setting Maintainer to Debian QA Group.\n  * Apply patch from James Troup to fix build issues.

Thanks to Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>\n      for reporting a similar problem with the lilypond package.  :-)\n  * Removed postinst and prerm and adjusted debian/GNUmakefile accordingly,\n    as Yodl's info files are not built or installed for this release.\n  * [debian/control]: Oops!  Forgot to add dependencies!  :-)\n      Added \"Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}\"\n      and \"Recommends: python-base (>= 1.5.1)\".\n\n -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Oct 1998 14:47:05 -0600\n\nyodl (1.31.2-1) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * New upstream release.\n  * Applied patch 1.31.2.jbr1:\n      - src/yodl/grampipethrough.c: A popen _must_ be closed with a\n        pclose _not_ a fclose.  Pipes were never getting closed on\n        Windows NT cygnus.\n  * [Documentation/GNUmakefile]: Added \"texinfo\" to \"default:\",\n      otherwise Documentation/out/yodl.info* would not be built\n      and \"make install\" would complain.\n  * [debian/postinst,debian/prerm]: Added calls to install-info.\n  * [Documentation/links.yo]: The e-mail address and command for subscribing\n      to the Yodl Mailing List was wrong.

Yodlverbinsert ignores initial and\n    trailing blank lines.\n\n * Removed some compiler warnings, among which a strange statement in\n    parser/pbeginnested.cc, where pp->d_insert was assigned a value within\n    the condition of a conditional assignment. See the difference between the\n    git-commit at Tue Sep 23 09:45:29 2014 +0200 and the next commit.\n\n -- Frank B.

The macros for man- and manual-pages are\n    now constructed under tmp/wip, so they can't conflict anymore with the\n    distribution macros which are constructed under tmp/install. The\n    xlatin1.bug was observed intermittently, making its fix kind of\n    difficult. \n\n  * Added the file icmake/README explaining the steps/elements of the macro\n    construction process.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 09 Oct 2013 12:47:12 +0200\n\nyodl (3.02.1)\n\n  * Repaired recurrent bug, fixed since yodl 2.14.4, about missing local-path\n    location specification in scripts/createmacros causing xlatin1.tex to be\n    included as ./xlatin1.tex.\n\n  * Modified Yodl's build script's 'build sf' mode\n\nyodl (3.02.0)\n\n  * Repaired failing `return to parent directory' after INCLUDEFILE\n    bug, intermittently observed th txt-files.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 21 May 2013 09:39:58 +0200\n\nyodl (3.01.0)\n\n  * Re-implemented l_chdir in src/lexer/lchdir.c and new_getcwd in\n    src/new/getcwd.c following compilation problems on GNU-hurd, as reported\n    by Svante Signell\n\n  * Yodl's build script now honors CFLAGS en LDFLAGS environment variables.\n\n  * Repaired some inconsistencies in the INSTALL.txt file\n\n  * The yodl2whatever script sets the path to the yodl binaries as configured\n    unless the YODL_BIN environment variable has been set, in which case that\n    environment variable' value is used as the path prefix when calling yodl\n    programs. \n\n  * Added 'build sf' to create the files to be uploaded to sourceforge. This\n    function is for Internal Use Only\n\n  * Renamed the 'sourceforge' directory to 'sf'\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 10 Mar 2013 12:37:45 +0100\n\nyodl (3.00.0)\n\n  * When including files the included file's directory path becomes the\n    cwd. This results in file-inclusion handling like C's #include directive.\n    Previously the cwd remained fixed, causing problems if the same \n    files are included for different documents where these included files\n    themselves also include files. The -L (--legacy-include) option can be\n    specified to prevent the change of working directory (and thus to revert\n    to the original handling of includefile specifications.\n\n  * The includefile macro no longer defines a label equal to its argument just\n    before the file is included. Instead the macro lincludefile can be used,\n    which provides more control of the label that is defined, if required. The\n    added benefit is a *much* smaller .idx file, resulting in faster\n    processing. \n\n  * The recognition of filenames no longer favors files without extensions\n    above files having the .yo extension. Files to be included are supposed to\n    have a .yo (=DEFAULT_EXT) extension (using (l)includefile), but the\n    extension does not have to be explicitly specified. Only if no file having\n    the DEFAULT_EXT is found the file is attempted as specified.\n\n  * Single-line functions whose addresses are not required are now inline\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 07 Nov 2010 17:18:05 +0100\n\nyodl (2.15.2)\n\n  * Added macro cellsline to set multiple horizontal lines in one table row.\n\n  * Bug fix in yodlverbinsert (confused markers provided as command-line\n    argument with markers to which additional characters were appended\n    appearing in scanned files).\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 12 Mar 2010 10:50:13 +0100\n\nyodl (2.15.1)\n\n  * Added a chartable translation to macros/yodl/chartables/man.tables.yo: in\n    man-pages the - character is by default interpreted as hyphen, not as\n    minus. The chartable now defines    '-' = \"\\\\-\"    turning - characters\n    into man-page minus characters. Forced hyphens can be written as \n    manpagecommand(\\CHAR(40)hy)\n\n  * Added scripts/hrefnotmpinstall (href no tmp/install) removing tmp/install\n    hyperlinks from html-version of the manual: given yodl.html, \n    the manual pages now link locally to each other.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 27 Jul 2009 11:32:35 +0200\n\nyodl (2.15.0)\n\n  * Detected a bug! Lines starting with + characters (like +NOTRANS, but also\n    \\'e since those constructions are substituded by +NOTRANS... sequences)\n    were not properly converted: the + appeared in the output. Caused by\n    p_handledefaultnewline, separating the + from its trailing chars. Repaired\n    by testing for an initial +, followed by adding what's trailing if found.\n\n  * The yodlbuiltin man-page (not appearing in the distribution) is now added.\n\n  * The subscript and superscript macro descriptions were improved.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 16 Jul 2009 22:38:57 +0200\n\nyodl (2.14.4)\n\n  * Missing local-path location specification in scripts/createmacros caused\n    xlatin1.tex to be included as ./xlatin1.tex. Now repaired.\n\n  * Yodl2whatever's --intermediate option didn't accept a (file) argument. Now\n    repaired. \n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 13 May 2009 11:38:42 +0200\n\nyodl (2.14.3)\n\n  * Tony Mancill and George Danchev discovered a flaw in the build script: it\n    used previously installed macro files. Now repaired: Installation should\n    run fine on a system not yet supporting Yodl.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 27 Apr 2009 20:56:33 +0200\n\nyodl (2.14.2)\n\n  * Yodl2whatever uses `eval' to call yodl. Without this --define options\n    are not properly recognized\n\n  * Build script completely rewritten\n\n  * Added striproff as the script `yodlstriproff', and renamed the manpage \n    accordingly\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 15 Apr 2009 19:58:05 +0200\n\nyodl (2.14.1)\n\n  * Build script allows separate construction of program, man pages and \n    manual, using the standard installation path or the binaries constructed\n    from the source package\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 21 Mar 2009 09:08:58 +0100\n\nyodl (2.14.0)\n\n  * Character tables now accept hexadecimal and octal constants in their\n    double quoted character redefinition strings.\n\n  * Double and single quotes appearing in man-page texts are now handled\n    properly: the double quote is set as \\(dq\\& and the single quote as \\(dq\\&\n\n  * All Yodl manual pages refer to all remaining Yodl manual pages\n\n  * Several warnings generated by cppcheck on `src/verbinsert.c' were\n    fixed. One remains, which turns out to be a cppcheck false positive.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 15 Mar 2009 13:11:08 +0100\n\nyodl (2.13.2)\n\n  * yodl2whatever did not remove intermediate files when no post processing\n    was required. Now repaired.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 24 Oct 2008 15:04:10 +0200\n\nyodl (2.13.1)\n\n  * yodl2whatever no longer supports the --unique-output and --path\n    option. Instead, communication between yodl and yodlpost is handled\n    through temporary files created by mktemp(1). The temporary files will be\n    removed following the yodl conversion. The yodl2whatever script offers the\n    --intermediate=filename option to allow users to keep the intermediate\n    files.\n\nyodl (2.12.2)\n\n  * TEMPORARY MODIFICATION: manual construction will not rebuild the yodl.pdf\n    file to circumvent a bug in ps2pdf on some architectures. The manual/pdf\n    directory will not be cleaned by `build clean'. To force the construction\n    of the yodl.pdf file call `build manual pdf' in the ./manual directory\n    immediately following the call of `build manual'.\n\nyodl (2.12.1)\n\n  * Introducing a subversion number: major.minor.subversion.\n\n  * yodlpost's `#define BLOCK_POSTQUEUE' is replaced by an `-l <size>' option,\n    by default using `-l 1000', allowing large(r) lines in index-files to be\n    processed. The old BLOCK_POSTQUEUE value was set at 500.\n \n  * All symbols starting with _ were renamed to symbols from which the _ was\n    removed.\n\n  * Repaired the [nl]subsubsect() macro that did not typeset a proper section \n    heading in html files. It does so now.\n\nyodl (2.11)\n\n  * repaired src/yodl/gramuppercase.c src/yodl/grampushmacro.c \n    src/yodl/gramdefinemacro.c in which addresses of\n    size_t variables were passed to functions expecting addresses of ints\n    comparable modifications to yodl/src/yodlpost/handlexmltocentry.c\n    yodl/src/yodlpost/handlehtmltocentry.c yodl/src/yodlpost/handlexmltoc.c\n    yodl/src/yodlpost/handletxttocentry.c\n  * The hm_pjw function in hashmap/hmpjw.c uses a different procedure to \n    determine the most significant nibble, producing the same hashvalues as\n    the previous version.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 12 Mar 2007 20:28:34 +0100\n\nyodl (2.10)\n\n  * repaired scores of compilation warnings in the sources detected by \n    Daniel Richard G. while compiling for the amd64.\n\n  * Changed the organization of the Stack: it now consists of unions, allowing\n    for cast-less storage and retrieval of various types. With it comes a\n    slight reorganization of the code: the Media struct, till now defined in\n    the lexer.ih file has its struct defined separately in src/mediastruct in\n    order to allow Stack access to it. See src/HIERARCHY for an overview.\n\n  * Moved l_media functions from lexer to new class Media, required for the\n    new Stack organization\n\n  * The src/build script contains #defines allowing extensive compilation\n    tests (as suggested by Daniel Richard G.) as well as compilations for\n    gprof, the GNU profiler. Running the profiler after building the yodl\n    manual shows that currenly no clear speedup-targets exist.\n\n  * The appendix() macro now creates html chapters starting at 1, as suggested\n    by Karel Kubat.\n\n  * The yodl2whatever script now handles versions of the getopt(1) program\n    that can't handle long options. They still can't be handled, but the\n    script now doesn't break. Long options defined for the script itself are\n    still recognized (--no-warnings, --tmp, --unique-output).\n\n  * Some systems (Notably: Mac OSX) apparently don't support the getline()\n    function, used in the verbinsert program. Verbinsert now contains its own\n    version: `y_getline()'\n\n  * Added the euro() macro setting the euro symbol.\n\n  * Removed the ./debian subdirectory which does not belong to the Yodl\n    package itself. The Debian packaging files can be obtained from, e.g.,\n    https://svn.openfmi.net/debian-addons-bg/yodl\n\n  * Changed unsigned into size_t where appropriate.\n\nyodl (2.04a)\n  * repaired <txt> definition of lchapter.raw, which put the label, rather \n    than the chapter's title in the document's contents.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 05 Sep 2006 16:32:08 +0200\n\nyodl (2.04)\n\n    From patches offered by Colin Watson:\n\n  * gcc's printf format checking features is used where available.\n  * Memory properly freed on error path in construct_tocentry.\n  * Reuse of va_list in string_vformat is fixed; the correct way to do this is\n    to va_copy it first, although this requires some care regarding\n    portability.\n  \n    Additional modification:\n\n  * The generic `yodl2whatever' has been given two more options to allow users\n    to prevent file-collisions when the same user calls yodl to process a\n    document while another invokation of yodl by that user is still running:\n\n    --tmp=<path>: By default, the temporary file is written in the /tmp\n                   directory. Specify an alternate directory using \n                   --tmp = path-to-alternate-tmp-directory\n    --unique-output: By default, yodl will use a temporary output file that \n                   is rewritten at each new yodl-invokation. If that's not \n                   what you want, specify the --unique-output flag, which\n                   will use the process-id as part of the temporary output\n                   file. This file is NOT removed when the yodl-conversion\n                   fails. \n\n    The yodl2whatever man-page is modified accordingly.\n\nyodl (2.03)\n\n  * Added the program `yodlverbinsert', placing the contents of a `labeled\n    section' from some text file (usually a C or C++ source) in a verb()\n    macro, writing the generated verb() command to the standard output stream.\n    Updated the user guide accordingly and added a manual page: `man\n    yodlverbinsert' gives details and examples.\n\nyodl (2.02) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Following suggestions by Karel Kubat, several data files were modified:\n    global variables are initialized to prevent compilation problems. Also,\n    Karel's contrib/build.pl script was modified by Karel. I changed the\n    initialization of the $config{TOPLEVEL_VERSION} so that it first tries to\n    read the current toplevel version from the src/config.h file, to promote\n    version synchronization.\n\n    Some minor changes to macro files were made, and several superfluous files\n    were removed from the distribution.\n\n    Adapted several debian-files, updating the standards and debhelper\n    versions, removed debian/ from the .orig archive and added an upstream\n    changelog file, keeping this file for future Debian changes only. The \n    initial version of the upstream-changelog file is this file: Yodl's\n    debian/changelog until (including) version 2.02.\n\n    Disregard the comment in version 2.01.03 about plans to discontinue\n    icmake. Icmake's build script will be kept and will remain to be yodl's \n    main build-tool. Many functions used in the src/build script have been\n    rebuilt, resulting in the removal of many system-function calls and thus\n    increasing its speed of execution.\n\n    Compilation warnings in src/subst/substaction.c and src/process/pparent.c\n    were solved.\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 23 Aug 2006 10:42:12 +0200\n\nyodl (2.01.03) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * The XXtocclearpage symbol, used by the tocclearpage() and notocclearpage()\n    macros, was erroneously defined for the HTML convertor instead of the\n    LaTeX convertor. Also, the macro tocclearpage() did not assign a non-empty\n    value to the XXtocclearpage macro, so the macro had no effect.\n    \n    Added the file yodl/debian/compat\n    \n    Following suggestions by Karel Kubat, macros/rawmacros/footnote.raw was\n    modified for HTML-usage. With the HTML convertor a non-breakable space is\n    inserted before the (parenthesized) footnote-text.\n    \n    A `contrib' directory is created below /usr/share/doc/yodl. Currently it\n    contains a perl-script `build.pl' that may be used to create the\n    yodl-package. It is not maintained by me (Frank), but was supplied by\n    Karel Kubat. Note that it does not update the program version, but uses a\n    hard-coded version as set by the script. Karel (karel@e-tunity.com) should\n    be contacted for any questions related to this script. Furthermore, the\n    dependency on `icmake' will probably be removed from Yodl in the near\n    future: I'm planning to standardize the package building using a series of\n    generic shell-scripts, which may render the build.pl script obsolete as\n    well.\n    \n    The build-script will now install in yodl/yodl/debian/yodl instead of\n    yodl/yodl/debian/tmp\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 13 Mar 2006 20:53:23 +0100\n\nyodl (2.01.02) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Changed the lsect(), lsubsect(), lsubsubsect(), sect(), subsect() and\n    subsubsect() macros (for html and xml use) since the l...() macros set the\n    lastnumber value too late. New XX...sect[Counter].raw files were defined\n    to factorize common parts. The l...sect() macros now first set the next\n    section number, and then define a label. Finally the section code is\n    inserted. The ...sect() macros set the counter, followed by the section's\n    code. \n\n    Furthermore, added n-tilde and N-tilde definitions to chartables.\n\n    Note the change of my e-mail address: it's now @rug.nl, instead of\n    @rc.rug.nl\n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 29 Jul 2005 14:38:57 +0200\n\nyodl (2.01.01) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Ai, another leftover from the previous bug-repair: if the suspected\n    macro call was already part of the set if supected macros calls the\n    already read open parentheses wasn't pushed back. It's now repaired.\n\n    Also, followed Karel's suggestion to do system(\"rm -rf bin/* libyodl.a\n    */o/*\"); in yodl/src/build, rather than just -f, in order to removed \n    any CVS directories that might be there as well. Since this part should\n    not contain any useful info for CVS it shouldn't matter that CVS is \n    removed. \n\n -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rc.rug.nl>  Thu, 20 Jan 2005 08:23:11 +0100\n\nyodl (2.01.00) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * Forced subdir creation at manual construction (in yodl/manual: html/\n    latex/ pdf/ ps/ txt/), as suggested by Karel Kubat\n\n    Repaired a bug in the man-page construction in yodlpost:\n    handle_ignore_ws didn't ignore multiple white lines. Repaired by\n    adding appropriate test\n\n    Repaired a bug in yodl itself:\n    -w flag eats initial openparen of parenthesized list. Not specifying -w\n    doesn't. Repaired by pushing back an open-parenthesis after recognizing a\n    suspected user macro which doesn't turn out to be a user macro in\n    src/parser/pnousermacro.c. See the comments in that source for details.\n\n -- Frank B.

Happened only here.\n    Added some comment to file_copy2offset() itself, and repaired\n    itemization() and enumeration() macros.  \n    Added minor modifications to macros/build and manual/yo/manual.yo.\n\n -- Frank B.
