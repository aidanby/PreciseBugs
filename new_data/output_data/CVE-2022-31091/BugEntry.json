2015-07-04\n\n* Fixed a memory leak in the curl handlers in which references to callbacks\n  were not being removed by `curl_reset`.\n* Cookies are now extracted properly before redirects.\n* Cookies now allow more character ranges.\n* Decoded Content-Encoding responses are now modified to correctly reflect\n  their state if the encoding was automatically removed by a handler. This\n  means that the `Content-Encoding` header may be removed an the\n  `Content-Length` modified to reflect the message size after removing the\n  encoding.\n* Added a more explicit error message when trying to use `form_params` and\n  `multipart` in the same request.\n* Several fixes for HHVM support.\n* Functions are now conditionally required using an additional level of\n  indirection to help with global Composer installations.\n\n## 6.0.1 - 2015-05-27\n\n* Fixed a bug with serializing the `query` request option where the `&`\n  separator was missing.\n* Added a better error message for when `body` is provided as an array.

These need to be\n  present on the provided handler in order to work.\n* Requests are no longer initiated when sending async requests with the\n  CurlMultiHandler. This prevents unexpected recursion from requests completing\n  while ticking the cURL loop.\n* Removed the semantics of setting `default` to `true`. This is no longer\n  required now that the cURL loop is not ticked for async requests.\n* Added request and response logging middleware.\n* No longer allowing self signed certificates when using the StreamHandler.\n* Ensuring that `sink` is valid if saving to a file.\n* Request exceptions now include a \"handler context\" which provides handler\n  specific contextual information.\n* Added `GuzzleHttp\\RequestOptions` to allow request options to be applied\n  using constants.\n* `$maxHandles` has been removed from CurlMultiHandler.\n* `MultipartPostBody` is now part of the `guzzlehttp/psr7` package.\n\n## 5.3.0 - 2015-05-19\n\n* Mock now supports `save_to`\n* Marked `AbstractRequestEvent::getTransaction()` as public.\n* Fixed a bug in which multiple headers using different casing would overwrite\n  previous headers in the associative array.\n* Added `Utils::getDefaultHandler()`\n* Marked `GuzzleHttp\\Client::getDefaultUserAgent` as deprecated.\n* URL scheme is now always lowercased.\n\n## 6.0.0-beta.1\n\n* Requires PHP >= 5.5\n* Updated to use PSR-7\n  * Requires immutable messages, which basically means an event based system\n    owned by a request instance is no longer possible.\n  * Utilizing the [Guzzle PSR-7 package](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7).\n  * Removed the dependency on `guzzlehttp/streams`. These stream abstractions\n    are available in the `guzzlehttp/psr7` package under the `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7`\n    namespace.\n* Added middleware and handler system\n  * Replaced the Guzzle event and subscriber system with a middleware system.\n  * No longer depends on RingPHP, but rather places the HTTP handlers directly\n    in Guzzle, operating on PSR-7 messages.\n  * Retry logic is now encapsulated in `GuzzleHttp\\Middleware::retry`, which\n    means the `guzzlehttp/retry-subscriber` is now obsolete.\n  * Mocking responses is now handled using `GuzzleHttp\\Handler\\MockHandler`.\n* Asynchronous responses\n  * No longer supports the `future` request option to send an async request.\n    Instead, use one of the `*Async` methods of a client (e.g., `requestAsync`,\n    `getAsync`, etc.).\n  * Utilizing `GuzzleHttp\\Promise` instead of React's promise library to avoid\n    recursion required by chaining and forwarding react promises. See\n    https://github.com/guzzle/promises\n  * Added `requestAsync` and `sendAsync` to send request asynchronously.\n  * Added magic methods for `getAsync()`, `postAsync()`, etc. to send requests\n    asynchronously.\n* Request options\n  * POST and form updates\n    * Added the `form_fields` and `form_files` request options.\n    * Removed the `GuzzleHttp\\Post` namespace.\n    * The `body` request option no longer accepts an array for POST requests.\n  * The `exceptions` request option has been deprecated in favor of the\n    `http_errors` request options.\n  * The `save_to` request option has been deprecated in favor of `sink` request\n    option.\n* Clients no longer accept an array of URI template string and variables for\n  URI variables. You will need to expand URI templates before passing them\n  into a client constructor or request method.\n* Client methods `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `patch()`, `options()`, etc. are\n  now magic methods that will send synchronous requests.\n* Replaced `Utils.php` with plain functions in `functions.php`.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\Collection`.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\BatchResults`. Batched pool results are now returned as\n  an array.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\Query`. Query string handling is now handled using an\n  associative array passed into the `query` request option. The query string\n  is serialized using PHP's `http_build_query`. If you need more control, you\n  can pass the query string in as a string.\n* `GuzzleHttp\\QueryParser` has been replaced with the\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\parse_query`.\n\n## 5.2.0 - 2015-01-27\n\n* Added `AppliesHeadersInterface` to make applying headers to a request based\n  on the body more generic and not specific to `PostBodyInterface`.\n* Reduced the number of stack frames needed to send requests.\n* Nested futures are now resolved in the client rather than the RequestFsm\n* Finishing state transitions is now handled in the RequestFsm rather than the\n  RingBridge.\n* Added a guard in the Pool class to not use recursion for request retries.\n\n## 5.1.0 - 2014-12-19\n\n* Pool class no longer uses recursion when a request is intercepted.\n* The size of a Pool can now be dynamically adjusted using a callback.\n  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/943.\n* Setting a request option to `null` when creating a request with a client will\n  ensure that the option is not set. This allows you to overwrite default\n  request options on a per-request basis.\n  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/937.\n* Added the ability to limit which protocols are allowed for redirects by\n  specifying a `protocols` array in the `allow_redirects` request option.\n* Nested futures due to retries are now resolved when waiting for synchronous\n  responses. See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/947.\n* `\"0\"` is now an allowed URI path. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/935.\n* `Query` no longer typehints on the `$query` argument in the constructor,\n  allowing for strings and arrays.\n* Exceptions thrown in the `end` event are now correctly wrapped with Guzzle\n  specific exceptions if necessary.\n\n## 5.0.3 - 2014-11-03\n\nThis change updates query strings so that they are treated as un-encoded values\nby default where the value represents an un-encoded value to send over the\nwire. A Query object then encodes the value before sending over the wire. This\nmeans that even value query string values (e.g., \":\") are url encoded. This\nmakes the Query class match PHP's http_build_query function. However, if you\nwant to send requests over the wire using valid query string characters that do\nnot need to be encoded, then you can provide a string to Url::setQuery() and\npass true as the second argument to specify that the query string is a raw\nstring that should not be parsed or encoded (unless a call to getQuery() is\nsubsequently made, forcing the query-string to be converted into a Query\nobject).\n\n## 5.0.2 - 2014-10-30\n\n* Added a trailing `\\r\\n` to multipart/form-data payloads. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/871\n* Added a `GuzzleHttp\\Pool::send()` convenience method to match the docs.\n* Status codes are now returned as integers. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/881\n* No longer overwriting an existing `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header\n  when sending POST requests, allowing for customized headers. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/877\n* Improved path URL serialization.\n\n  * No longer double percent-encoding characters in the path or query string if\n    they are already encoded.\n  * Now properly encoding the supplied path to a URL object, instead of only\n    encoding ' ' and '?'.\n  * Note: This has been changed in 5.0.3 to now encode query string values by\n    default unless the `rawString` argument is provided when setting the query\n    string on a URL: Now allowing many more characters to be present in the\n    query string without being percent encoded. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-A\n\n## 5.0.1 - 2014-10-16\n\nBugfix release.\n\n* Fixed an issue where connection errors still returned response object in\n  error and end events event though the response is unusable. This has been\n  corrected so that a response is not returned in the `getResponse` method of\n  these events if the response did not complete. https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/867\n* Fixed an issue where transfer statistics were not being populated in the\n  RingBridge. https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/866\n\n## 5.0.0 - 2014-10-12\n\nAdding support for non-blocking responses and some minor API cleanup.\n\n### New Features\n\n* Added support for non-blocking responses based on `guzzlehttp/guzzle-ring`.\n* Added a public API for creating a default HTTP adapter.\n* Updated the redirect plugin to be non-blocking so that redirects are sent\n  concurrently. Other plugins like this can now be updated to be non-blocking.\n* Added a \"progress\" event so that you can get upload and download progress\n  events.\n* Added `GuzzleHttp\\Pool` which implements FutureInterface and transfers\n  requests concurrently using a capped pool size as efficiently as possible.\n* Added `hasListeners()` to EmitterInterface.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::sendAll` and marked\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Client::sendAll` as deprecated (it's still there, just not the\n  recommended way).\n\n### Breaking changes\n\nThe breaking changes in this release are relatively minor. The biggest thing to\nlook out for is that request and response objects no longer implement fluent\ninterfaces.\n\n* Removed the fluent interfaces (i.e., `return $this`) from requests,\n  responses, `GuzzleHttp\\Collection`, `GuzzleHttp\\Url`,\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Query`, `GuzzleHttp\\Post\\PostBody`, and\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\SetCookie`. This blog post provides a good outline of\n  why I did this: https://ocramius.github.io/blog/fluent-interfaces-are-evil/.\n  This also makes the Guzzle message interfaces compatible with the current\n  PSR-7 message proposal.\n* Removed \"functions.php\", so that Guzzle is truly PSR-4 compliant. Except\n  for the HTTP request functions from function.php, these functions are now\n  implemented in `GuzzleHttp\\Utils` using camelCase. `GuzzleHttp\\json_decode`\n  moved to `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::jsonDecode`. `GuzzleHttp\\get_path` moved to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::getPath`. `GuzzleHttp\\set_path` moved to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::setPath`. `GuzzleHttp\\batch` should now be\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Pool::batch`, which returns an `objectStorage`. Using functions.php\n  caused problems for many users: they aren't PSR-4 compliant, require an\n  explicit include, and needed an if-guard to ensure that the functions are not\n  declared multiple times.\n* Rewrote adapter layer.\n    * Removing all classes from `GuzzleHttp\\Adapter`, these are now\n      implemented as callables that are stored in `GuzzleHttp\\Ring\\Client`.\n    * Removed the concept of \"parallel adapters\". Sending requests serially or\n      concurrently is now handled using a single adapter.\n    * Moved `GuzzleHttp\\Adapter\\Transaction` to `GuzzleHttp\\Transaction`. The\n      Transaction object now exposes the request, response, and client as public\n      properties. The getters and setters have been removed.\n* Removed the \"headers\" event. This event was only useful for changing the\n  body a response once the headers of the response were known. You can implement\n  a similar behavior in a number of ways. One example might be to use a\n  FnStream that has access to the transaction being sent. For example, when the\n  first byte is written, you could check if the response headers match your\n  expectations, and if so, change the actual stream body that is being\n  written to.\n* Removed the `asArray` parameter from\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\MessageInterface::getHeader`. If you want to get a header\n  value as an array, then use the newly added `getHeaderAsArray()` method of\n  `MessageInterface`. This change makes the Guzzle interfaces compatible with\n  the PSR-7 interfaces.\n* `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\MessageFactory` no longer allows subclasses to add\n  custom request options using double-dispatch (this was an implementation\n  detail). Instead, you should now provide an associative array to the\n  constructor which is a mapping of the request option name mapping to a\n  function that applies the option value to a request.\n* Removed the concept of \"throwImmediately\" from exceptions and error events.\n  This control mechanism was used to stop a transfer of concurrent requests\n  from completing. This can now be handled by throwing the exception or by\n  cancelling a pool of requests or each outstanding future request individually.\n* Updated to \"GuzzleHttp\\Streams\" 3.0.\n    * `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\StreamInterface::getContents()` no longer accepts a\n      `maxLen` parameter. This update makes the Guzzle streams project\n      compatible with the current PSR-7 proposal.\n    * `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Stream::__construct`,\n      `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Stream::factory`, and\n      `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Utils::create` no longer accept a size in the second\n      argument. They now accept an associative array of options, including the\n      \"size\" key and \"metadata\" key which can be used to provide custom metadata.\n\n## 4.2.2 - 2014-09-08\n\n* Fixed a memory leak in the CurlAdapter when reusing cURL handles.\n* No longer using `request_fulluri` in stream adapter proxies.\n* Relative redirects are now based on the last response, not the first response.\n\n## 4.2.1 - 2014-08-19\n\n* Ensuring that the StreamAdapter does not always add a Content-Type header\n* Adding automated github releases with a phar and zip\n\n## 4.2.0 - 2014-08-17\n\n* Now merging in default options using a case-insensitive comparison.\n  Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/767\n* Added the ability to automatically decode `Content-Encoding` response bodies\n  using the `decode_content` request option. This is set to `true` by default\n  to decode the response body if it comes over the wire with a\n  `Content-Encoding`. Set this value to `false` to disable decoding the\n  response content, and pass a string to provide a request `Accept-Encoding`\n  header and turn on automatic response decoding. This feature now allows you\n  to pass an `Accept-Encoding` header in the headers of a request but still\n  disable automatic response decoding.\n  Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/764\n* Added the ability to throw an exception immediately when transferring\n  requests in parallel. Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/760\n* Updating guzzlehttp/streams dependency to ~2.1\n* No longer utilizing the now deprecated namespaced methods from the stream\n  package.\n\n## 4.1.8 - 2014-08-14\n\n* Fixed an issue in the CurlFactory that caused setting the `stream=false`\n  request option to throw an exception.\n  See: https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/769\n* TransactionIterator now calls rewind on the inner iterator.\n  See: https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/765\n* You can now set the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`\n  when creating POST requests to force multipart bodies.\n  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/768\n\n## 4.1.7 - 2014-08-07\n\n* Fixed an error in the HistoryPlugin that caused the same request and response\n  to be logged multiple times when an HTTP protocol error occurs.\n* Ensuring that cURL does not add a default Content-Type when no Content-Type\n  has been supplied by the user. This prevents the adapter layer from modifying\n  the request that is sent over the wire after any listeners may have already\n  put the request in a desired state (e.g., signed the request).\n* Throwing an exception when you attempt to send requests that have the\n  \"stream\" set to true in parallel using the MultiAdapter.\n* Only calling curl_multi_select when there are active cURL handles. This was\n  previously changed and caused performance problems on some systems due to PHP\n  always selecting until the maximum select timeout.\n* Fixed a bug where multipart/form-data POST fields were not correctly\n  aggregated (e.g., values with \"&\").\n\n## 4.1.6 - 2014-08-03\n\n* Added helper methods to make it easier to represent messages as strings,\n  including getting the start line and getting headers as a string.\n\n## 4.1.5 - 2014-08-02\n\n* Automatically retrying cURL \"Connection died, retrying a fresh connect\"\n  errors when possible.\n* cURL implementation cleanup\n* Allowing multiple event subscriber listeners to be registered per event by\n  passing an array of arrays of listener configuration.\n\n## 4.1.4 - 2014-07-22\n\n* Fixed a bug that caused multi-part POST requests with more than one field to\n  serialize incorrectly.\n* Paths can now be set to \"0\"\n* `ResponseInterface::xml` now accepts a `libxml_options` option and added a\n  missing default argument that was required when parsing XML response bodies.\n* A `save_to` stream is now created lazily, which means that files are not\n  created on disk unless a request succeeds.\n\n## 4.1.3 - 2014-07-15\n\n* Various fixes to multipart/form-data POST uploads\n* Wrapping function.php in an if-statement to ensure Guzzle can be used\n  globally and in a Composer install\n* Fixed an issue with generating and merging in events to an event array\n* POST headers are only applied before sending a request to allow you to change\n  the query aggregator used before uploading\n* Added much more robust query string parsing\n* Fixed various parsing and normalization issues with URLs\n* Fixing an issue where multi-valued headers were not being utilized correctly\n  in the StreamAdapter\n\n## 4.1.2 - 2014-06-18\n\n* Added support for sending payloads with GET requests\n\n## 4.1.1 - 2014-06-08\n\n* Fixed an issue related to using custom message factory options in subclasses\n* Fixed an issue with nested form fields in a multi-part POST\n* Fixed an issue with using the `json` request option for POST requests\n* Added `ToArrayInterface` to `GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\CookieJar`\n\n## 4.1.0 - 2014-05-27\n\n* Added a `json` request option to easily serialize JSON payloads.\n* Added a `GuzzleHttp\\json_decode()` wrapper to safely parse JSON.\n* Added `setPort()` and `getPort()` to `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\RequestInterface`.\n* Added the ability to provide an emitter to a client in the client constructor.\n* Added the ability to persist a cookie session using $_SESSION.\n* Added a trait that can be used to add event listeners to an iterator.\n* Removed request method constants from RequestInterface.\n* Fixed warning when invalid request start-lines are received.\n* Updated MessageFactory to work with custom request option methods.\n* Updated cacert bundle to latest build.\n\n4.0.2 (2014-04-16)\n------------------\n\n* Proxy requests using the StreamAdapter now properly use request_fulluri (#632)\n* Added the ability to set scalars as POST fields (#628)\n\n## 4.0.1 - 2014-04-04\n\n* The HTTP status code of a response is now set as the exception code of\n  RequestException objects.\n* 303 redirects will now correctly switch from POST to GET requests.\n* The default parallel adapter of a client now correctly uses the MultiAdapter.\n* HasDataTrait now initializes the internal data array as an empty array so\n  that the toArray() method always returns an array.\n\n## 4.0.0 - 2014-03-29\n\n* For information on changes and upgrading, see:\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/blob/master/UPGRADING.md#3x-to-40\n* Added `GuzzleHttp\\batch()` as a convenience function for sending requests in\n  parallel without needing to write asynchronous code.\n* Restructured how events are added to `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::sendAll()`.\n  You can now pass a callable or an array of associative arrays where each\n  associative array contains the \"fn\", \"priority\", and \"once\" keys.\n\n## 4.0.0.rc-2 - 2014-03-25\n\n* Removed `getConfig()` and `setConfig()` from clients to avoid confusion\n  around whether things like base_url, message_factory, etc. should be able to\n  be retrieved or modified.\n* Added `getDefaultOption()` and `setDefaultOption()` to ClientInterface\n* functions.php functions were renamed using snake_case to match PHP idioms\n* Added support for `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and\n  `GUZZLE_CURL_SELECT_TIMEOUT` environment variables\n* Added the ability to specify custom `sendAll()` event priorities\n* Added the ability to specify custom stream context options to the stream\n  adapter.\n* Added a functions.php function for `get_path()` and `set_path()`\n* CurlAdapter and MultiAdapter now use a callable to generate curl resources\n* MockAdapter now properly reads a body and emits a `headers` event\n* Updated Url class to check if a scheme and host are set before adding \":\"\n  and \"//\". This allows empty Url (e.g., \"\") to be serialized as \"\".\n* Parsing invalid XML no longer emits warnings\n* Curl classes now properly throw AdapterExceptions\n* Various performance optimizations\n* Streams are created with the faster `Stream\\create()` function\n* Marked deprecation_proxy() as internal\n* Test server is now a collection of static methods on a class\n\n## 4.0.0-rc.1 - 2014-03-15\n\n* See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/blob/master/UPGRADING.md#3x-to-40\n\n## 3.8.1 - 2014-01-28\n\n* Bug: Always using GET requests when redirecting from a 303 response\n* Bug: CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST is now correctly set to false when setting `$certificateAuthority` to false in\n  `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::setSslVerification()`\n* Bug: RedirectPlugin now uses strict RFC 3986 compliance when combining a base URL with a relative URL\n* Bug: The body of a request can now be set to `\"0\"`\n* Sending PHP stream requests no longer forces `HTTP/1.0`\n* Adding more information to ExceptionCollection exceptions so that users have more context, including a stack trace of\n  each sub-exception\n* Updated the `$ref` attribute in service descriptions to merge over any existing parameters of a schema (rather than\n  clobbering everything).\n* Merging URLs will now use the query string object from the relative URL (thus allowing custom query aggregators)\n* Query strings are now parsed in a way that they do no convert empty keys with no value to have a dangling `=`.\n  For example `foo&bar=baz` is now correctly parsed and recognized as `foo&bar=baz` rather than `foo=&bar=baz`.\n* Now properly escaping the regular expression delimiter when matching Cookie domains.\n* Network access is now disabled when loading XML documents\n\n## 3.8.0 - 2013-12-05\n\n* Added the ability to define a POST name for a file\n* JSON response parsing now properly walks additionalProperties\n* cURL error code 18 is now retried automatically in the BackoffPlugin\n* Fixed a cURL error when URLs contain fragments\n* Fixed an issue in the BackoffPlugin retry event where it was trying to access all exceptions as if they were\n  CurlExceptions\n* CURLOPT_PROGRESS function fix for PHP 5.5 (69fcc1e)\n* Added the ability for Guzzle to work with older versions of cURL that do not support `CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS`\n* Fixed a bug that was encountered when parsing empty header parameters\n* UriTemplate now has a `setRegex()` method to match the docs\n* The `debug` request parameter now checks if it is truthy rather than if it exists\n* Setting the `debug` request parameter to true shows verbose cURL output instead of using the LogPlugin\n* Added the ability to combine URLs using strict RFC 3986 compliance\n* Command objects can now return the validation errors encountered by the command\n* Various fixes to cache revalidation (#437 and 29797e5)\n* Various fixes to the AsyncPlugin\n* Cleaned up build scripts\n\n## 3.7.4 - 2013-10-02\n\n* Bug fix: 0 is now an allowed value in a description parameter that has a default value (#430)\n* Bug fix: SchemaFormatter now returns an integer when formatting to a Unix timestamp\n  (see https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/147)\n* Bug fix: Cleaned up and fixed URL dot segment removal to properly resolve internal dots\n* Minimum PHP version is now properly specified as 5.3.3 (up from 5.3.2) (#420)\n* Updated the bundled cacert.pem (#419)\n* OauthPlugin now supports adding authentication to headers or query string (#425)\n\n## 3.7.3 - 2013-09-08\n\n* Added the ability to get the exception associated with a request/command when using `MultiTransferException` and\n  `CommandTransferException`.\n* Setting `additionalParameters` of a response to false is now honored when parsing responses with a service description\n* Schemas are only injected into response models when explicitly configured.\n* No longer guessing Content-Type based on the path of a request.

You can pass a 'request.options' configuration setting to a client to apply default request options to\n  every request created by a client (e.g. default query string variables, headers, curl options, etc.).\n* Added a static facade class that allows you to use Guzzle with static methods and mount the class to `\\Guzzle`.\n  See `Guzzle\\Http\\StaticClient::mount`.\n* Added `command.request_options` to `Guzzle\\Service\\Command\\AbstractCommand` to pass request options to requests\n      created by a command (e.g. custom headers, query string variables, timeout settings, etc.).\n* Stream size in `Guzzle\\Stream\\PhpStreamRequestFactory` will now be set if Content-Length is returned in the\n  headers of a response\n* Added `Guzzle\\Common\\Collection::setPath($path, $value)` to set a value into an array using a nested key\n  (e.g. `$collection->setPath('foo/baz/bar', 'test'); echo $collection['foo']['bar']['bar'];`)\n* ServiceBuilders now support storing and retrieving arbitrary data\n* CachePlugin can now purge all resources for a given URI\n* CachePlugin can automatically purge matching cached items when a non-idempotent request is sent to a resource\n* CachePlugin now uses the Vary header to determine if a resource is a cache hit\n* `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Response` now implements `\\Serializable`\n* Added `Guzzle\\Cache\\CacheAdapterFactory::fromCache()` to more easily create cache adapters\n* `Guzzle\\Service\\ClientInterface::execute()` now accepts an array, single command, or Traversable\n* Fixed a bug in `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Header\\Link::addLink()`\n* Better handling of calculating the size of a stream in `Guzzle\\Stream\\Stream` using fstat() and caching the size\n* `Guzzle\\Common\\Exception\\ExceptionCollection` now creates a more readable exception message\n* Fixing BC break: Added back the MonologLogAdapter implementation rather than extending from PsrLog so that older\n  Symfony users can still use the old version of Monolog.\n* Fixing BC break: Added the implementation back in for `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\AbstractMessage::getTokenizedHeader()`.\n  Now triggering an E_USER_DEPRECATED warning when used. Use `$message->getHeader()->parseParams()`.\n* Several performance improvements to `Guzzle\\Common\\Collection`\n* Added an `$options` argument to the end of the following methods of `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface`:\n  createRequest, head, delete, put, patch, post, options, prepareRequest\n* Added an `$options` argument to the end of `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request\\RequestFactoryInterface::createRequest()`\n* Added an `applyOptions()` method to `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request\\RequestFactoryInterface`\n* Changed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::get($uri = null, $headers = null, $body = null)` to\n  `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::get($uri = null, $headers = null, $options = array())`. You can still pass in a\n  resource, string, or EntityBody into the $options parameter to specify the download location of the response.\n* Changed `Guzzle\\Common\\Collection::__construct($data)` to no longer accepts a null value for `$data` but a\n  default `array()`\n* Added `Guzzle\\Stream\\StreamInterface::isRepeatable`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::setDefaultHeaders(). Use\n  $client->getConfig()->setPath('request.options/headers/{header_name}', 'value')`. or\n  $client->getConfig()->setPath('request.options/headers', array('header_name' => 'value'))`.\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::getDefaultHeaders(). Use $client->getConfig()->getPath('request.options/headers')`.\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::expandTemplate()`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::setRequestFactory()`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::getCurlMulti()`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface::canCache`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface::setIsRedirect`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface::isRedirect`\n* Made `Guzzle\\Http\\Client::expandTemplate` and `getUriTemplate` protected methods.\n* You can now enable E_USER_DEPRECATED warnings to see if you are using a deprecated method by setting\n  `Guzzle\\Common\\Version::$emitWarnings` to true.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::isResponseBodyRepeatable()` as deprecated. Use\n      `$request->getResponseBody()->isRepeatable()` instead.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::canCache()` as deprecated. Use\n  `Guzzle\\Plugin\\Cache\\DefaultCanCacheStrategy->canCacheRequest()` instead.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::canCache()` as deprecated.

Use [request.options][params].\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Service\\Client::enableMagicMethods()` as deprecated. Magic methods can no longer be disabled on a Guzzle\\Service\\Client.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Service\\Client::getDefaultHeaders()` as deprecated. Use $client->getConfig()->getPath('request.options/headers')`.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Service\\Client::setDefaultHeaders()` as deprecated. Use $client->getConfig()->setPath('request.options/headers/{header_name}', 'value')`.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Parser\\Url\\UrlParser` as deprecated. Just use PHP's `parse_url()` and percent encode your UTF-8.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Common\\Collection::inject()` as deprecated.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Plugin\\CurlAuth\\CurlAuthPlugin` as deprecated. Use `$client->getConfig()->setPath('request.options/auth', array('user', 'pass', 'Basic|Digest');`\n* CacheKeyProviderInterface and DefaultCacheKeyProvider are no longer used. All of this logic is handled in a\n  CacheStorageInterface. These two objects and interface will be removed in a future version.\n* Always setting X-cache headers on cached responses\n* Default cache TTLs are now handled by the CacheStorageInterface of a CachePlugin\n* `CacheStorageInterface::cache($key, Response $response, $ttl = null)` has changed to `cache(RequestInterface\n  $request, Response $response);`\n* `CacheStorageInterface::fetch($key)` has changed to `fetch(RequestInterface $request);`\n* `CacheStorageInterface::delete($key)` has changed to `delete(RequestInterface $request);`\n* Added `CacheStorageInterface::purge($url)`\n* `DefaultRevalidation::__construct(CacheKeyProviderInterface $cacheKey, CacheStorageInterface $cache, CachePlugin\n  $plugin)` has changed to `DefaultRevalidation::__construct(CacheStorageInterface $cache,\n  CanCacheStrategyInterface $canCache = null)`\n* Added `RevalidationInterface::shouldRevalidate(RequestInterface $request, Response $response)`\n\n## 3.6.0 - 2013-05-29\n\n* ServiceDescription now implements ToArrayInterface\n* Added command.hidden_params to blacklist certain headers from being treated as additionalParameters\n* Guzzle can now correctly parse incomplete URLs\n* Mixed casing of headers are now forced to be a single consistent casing across all values for that header.\n* Messages internally use a HeaderCollection object to delegate handling case-insensitive header resolution\n* Removed the whole changedHeader() function system of messages because all header changes now go through addHeader().\n* Specific header implementations can be created for complex headers.

This allows you\n  to utilize other PSR-7 compatible libraries with Guzzle.\n- Supports PSR-18 allowing interoperability between other PSR-18 HTTP Clients.\n- Abstracts away the underlying HTTP transport, allowing you to write\n  environment and transport agnostic code; i.e., no hard dependency on cURL,\n  PHP streams, sockets, or non-blocking event loops.\n- Middleware system allows you to augment and compose client behavior.\n\n```php\n$client = new \\GuzzleHttp\\Client();\n$response = $client->request('GET', 'https://api.github.com/repos/guzzle/guzzle');\n\necho $response->getStatusCode(); // 200\necho $response->getHeaderLine('content-type'); // 'application/json; charset=utf8'\necho $response->getBody(); // '{\"id\": 1420053, \"name\": \"guzzle\", ...}'\n\n// Send an asynchronous request.\n$request = new \\GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org');\n$promise = $client->sendAsync($request)->then(function ($response) {\n    echo 'I completed!

2015-07-04\n\n* Fixed a memory leak in the curl handlers in which references to callbacks\n  were not being removed by `curl_reset`.\n* Cookies are now extracted properly before redirects.\n* Cookies now allow more character ranges.\n* Decoded Content-Encoding responses are now modified to correctly reflect\n  their state if the encoding was automatically removed by a handler. This\n  means that the `Content-Encoding` header may be removed an the\n  `Content-Length` modified to reflect the message size after removing the\n  encoding.\n* Added a more explicit error message when trying to use `form_params` and\n  `multipart` in the same request.\n* Several fixes for HHVM support.\n* Functions are now conditionally required using an additional level of\n  indirection to help with global Composer installations.\n\n## 6.0.1 - 2015-05-27\n\n* Fixed a bug with serializing the `query` request option where the `&`\n  separator was missing.\n* Added a better error message for when `body` is provided as an array. Please\n  use `form_params` or `multipart` instead.\n* Various doc fixes.\n\n## 6.0.0 - 2015-05-26\n\n* See the UPGRADING.md document for more information.\n* Added `multipart` and `form_params` request options.\n* Added `synchronous` request option.\n* Added the `on_headers` request option.\n* Fixed `expect` handling.\n* No longer adding default middlewares in the client ctor. These need to be\n  present on the provided handler in order to work.\n* Requests are no longer initiated when sending async requests with the\n  CurlMultiHandler. This prevents unexpected recursion from requests completing\n  while ticking the cURL loop.\n* Removed the semantics of setting `default` to `true`. This is no longer\n  required now that the cURL loop is not ticked for async requests.\n* Added request and response logging middleware.\n* No longer allowing self signed certificates when using the StreamHandler.\n* Ensuring that `sink` is valid if saving to a file.\n* Request exceptions now include a \"handler context\" which provides handler\n  specific contextual information.\n* Added `GuzzleHttp\\RequestOptions` to allow request options to be applied\n  using constants.\n* `$maxHandles` has been removed from CurlMultiHandler.\n* `MultipartPostBody` is now part of the `guzzlehttp/psr7` package.\n\n## 5.3.0 - 2015-05-19\n\n* Mock now supports `save_to`\n* Marked `AbstractRequestEvent::getTransaction()` as public.\n* Fixed a bug in which multiple headers using different casing would overwrite\n  previous headers in the associative array.\n* Added `Utils::getDefaultHandler()`\n* Marked `GuzzleHttp\\Client::getDefaultUserAgent` as deprecated.\n* URL scheme is now always lowercased.\n\n## 6.0.0-beta.1\n\n* Requires PHP >= 5.5\n* Updated to use PSR-7\n  * Requires immutable messages, which basically means an event based system\n    owned by a request instance is no longer possible.\n  * Utilizing the [Guzzle PSR-7 package](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7).\n  * Removed the dependency on `guzzlehttp/streams`. These stream abstractions\n    are available in the `guzzlehttp/psr7` package under the `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7`\n    namespace.\n* Added middleware and handler system\n  * Replaced the Guzzle event and subscriber system with a middleware system.\n  * No longer depends on RingPHP, but rather places the HTTP handlers directly\n    in Guzzle, operating on PSR-7 messages.\n  * Retry logic is now encapsulated in `GuzzleHttp\\Middleware::retry`, which\n    means the `guzzlehttp/retry-subscriber` is now obsolete.\n  * Mocking responses is now handled using `GuzzleHttp\\Handler\\MockHandler`.\n* Asynchronous responses\n  * No longer supports the `future` request option to send an async request.\n    Instead, use one of the `*Async` methods of a client (e.g., `requestAsync`,\n    `getAsync`, etc.).\n  * Utilizing `GuzzleHttp\\Promise` instead of React's promise library to avoid\n    recursion required by chaining and forwarding react promises. See\n    https://github.com/guzzle/promises\n  * Added `requestAsync` and `sendAsync` to send request asynchronously.\n  * Added magic methods for `getAsync()`, `postAsync()`, etc. to send requests\n    asynchronously.\n* Request options\n  * POST and form updates\n    * Added the `form_fields` and `form_files` request options.\n    * Removed the `GuzzleHttp\\Post` namespace.\n    * The `body` request option no longer accepts an array for POST requests.\n  * The `exceptions` request option has been deprecated in favor of the\n    `http_errors` request options.\n  * The `save_to` request option has been deprecated in favor of `sink` request\n    option.\n* Clients no longer accept an array of URI template string and variables for\n  URI variables. You will need to expand URI templates before passing them\n  into a client constructor or request method.\n* Client methods `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `patch()`, `options()`, etc. are\n  now magic methods that will send synchronous requests.\n* Replaced `Utils.php` with plain functions in `functions.php`.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\Collection`.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\BatchResults`. Batched pool results are now returned as\n  an array.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\Query`. Query string handling is now handled using an\n  associative array passed into the `query` request option. The query string\n  is serialized using PHP's `http_build_query`. If you need more control, you\n  can pass the query string in as a string.\n* `GuzzleHttp\\QueryParser` has been replaced with the\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\parse_query`.\n\n## 5.2.0 - 2015-01-27\n\n* Added `AppliesHeadersInterface` to make applying headers to a request based\n  on the body more generic and not specific to `PostBodyInterface`.\n* Reduced the number of stack frames needed to send requests.\n* Nested futures are now resolved in the client rather than the RequestFsm\n* Finishing state transitions is now handled in the RequestFsm rather than the\n  RingBridge.\n* Added a guard in the Pool class to not use recursion for request retries.\n\n## 5.1.0 - 2014-12-19\n\n* Pool class no longer uses recursion when a request is intercepted.\n* The size of a Pool can now be dynamically adjusted using a callback.\n  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/943.\n* Setting a request option to `null` when creating a request with a client will\n  ensure that the option is not set. This allows you to overwrite default\n  request options on a per-request basis.\n  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/937.\n* Added the ability to limit which protocols are allowed for redirects by\n  specifying a `protocols` array in the `allow_redirects` request option.\n* Nested futures due to retries are now resolved when waiting for synchronous\n  responses. See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/947.\n* `\"0\"` is now an allowed URI path. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/935.\n* `Query` no longer typehints on the `$query` argument in the constructor,\n  allowing for strings and arrays.\n* Exceptions thrown in the `end` event are now correctly wrapped with Guzzle\n  specific exceptions if necessary.\n\n## 5.0.3 - 2014-11-03\n\nThis change updates query strings so that they are treated as un-encoded values\nby default where the value represents an un-encoded value to send over the\nwire. A Query object then encodes the value before sending over the wire. This\nmeans that even value query string values (e.g., \":\") are url encoded. This\nmakes the Query class match PHP's http_build_query function. However, if you\nwant to send requests over the wire using valid query string characters that do\nnot need to be encoded, then you can provide a string to Url::setQuery() and\npass true as the second argument to specify that the query string is a raw\nstring that should not be parsed or encoded (unless a call to getQuery() is\nsubsequently made, forcing the query-string to be converted into a Query\nobject).\n\n## 5.0.2 - 2014-10-30\n\n* Added a trailing `\\r\\n` to multipart/form-data payloads. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/871\n* Added a `GuzzleHttp\\Pool::send()` convenience method to match the docs.\n* Status codes are now returned as integers. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/881\n* No longer overwriting an existing `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header\n  when sending POST requests, allowing for customized headers. See\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/877\n* Improved path URL serialization.\n\n  * No longer double percent-encoding characters in the path or query string if\n    they are already encoded.\n  * Now properly encoding the supplied path to a URL object, instead of only\n    encoding ' ' and '?'.\n  * Note: This has been changed in 5.0.3 to now encode query string values by\n    default unless the `rawString` argument is provided when setting the query\n    string on a URL: Now allowing many more characters to be present in the\n    query string without being percent encoded. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-A\n\n## 5.0.1 - 2014-10-16\n\nBugfix release.\n\n* Fixed an issue where connection errors still returned response object in\n  error and end events event though the response is unusable. This has been\n  corrected so that a response is not returned in the `getResponse` method of\n  these events if the response did not complete. https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/867\n* Fixed an issue where transfer statistics were not being populated in the\n  RingBridge. https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/866\n\n## 5.0.0 - 2014-10-12\n\nAdding support for non-blocking responses and some minor API cleanup.\n\n### New Features\n\n* Added support for non-blocking responses based on `guzzlehttp/guzzle-ring`.\n* Added a public API for creating a default HTTP adapter.\n* Updated the redirect plugin to be non-blocking so that redirects are sent\n  concurrently. Other plugins like this can now be updated to be non-blocking.\n* Added a \"progress\" event so that you can get upload and download progress\n  events.\n* Added `GuzzleHttp\\Pool` which implements FutureInterface and transfers\n  requests concurrently using a capped pool size as efficiently as possible.\n* Added `hasListeners()` to EmitterInterface.\n* Removed `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::sendAll` and marked\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Client::sendAll` as deprecated (it's still there, just not the\n  recommended way).\n\n### Breaking changes\n\nThe breaking changes in this release are relatively minor. The biggest thing to\nlook out for is that request and response objects no longer implement fluent\ninterfaces.\n\n* Removed the fluent interfaces (i.e., `return $this`) from requests,\n  responses, `GuzzleHttp\\Collection`, `GuzzleHttp\\Url`,\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Query`, `GuzzleHttp\\Post\\PostBody`, and\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\SetCookie`. This blog post provides a good outline of\n  why I did this: https://ocramius.github.io/blog/fluent-interfaces-are-evil/.\n  This also makes the Guzzle message interfaces compatible with the current\n  PSR-7 message proposal.\n* Removed \"functions.php\", so that Guzzle is truly PSR-4 compliant. Except\n  for the HTTP request functions from function.php, these functions are now\n  implemented in `GuzzleHttp\\Utils` using camelCase. `GuzzleHttp\\json_decode`\n  moved to `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::jsonDecode`. `GuzzleHttp\\get_path` moved to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::getPath`. `GuzzleHttp\\set_path` moved to\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Utils::setPath`. `GuzzleHttp\\batch` should now be\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Pool::batch`, which returns an `objectStorage`. Using functions.php\n  caused problems for many users: they aren't PSR-4 compliant, require an\n  explicit include, and needed an if-guard to ensure that the functions are not\n  declared multiple times.\n* Rewrote adapter layer.\n    * Removing all classes from `GuzzleHttp\\Adapter`, these are now\n      implemented as callables that are stored in `GuzzleHttp\\Ring\\Client`.\n    * Removed the concept of \"parallel adapters\". Sending requests serially or\n      concurrently is now handled using a single adapter.\n    * Moved `GuzzleHttp\\Adapter\\Transaction` to `GuzzleHttp\\Transaction`. The\n      Transaction object now exposes the request, response, and client as public\n      properties. The getters and setters have been removed.\n* Removed the \"headers\" event. This event was only useful for changing the\n  body a response once the headers of the response were known. You can implement\n  a similar behavior in a number of ways. One example might be to use a\n  FnStream that has access to the transaction being sent. For example, when the\n  first byte is written, you could check if the response headers match your\n  expectations, and if so, change the actual stream body that is being\n  written to.\n* Removed the `asArray` parameter from\n  `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\MessageInterface::getHeader`. If you want to get a header\n  value as an array, then use the newly added `getHeaderAsArray()` method of\n  `MessageInterface`. This change makes the Guzzle interfaces compatible with\n  the PSR-7 interfaces.\n* `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\MessageFactory` no longer allows subclasses to add\n  custom request options using double-dispatch (this was an implementation\n  detail). Instead, you should now provide an associative array to the\n  constructor which is a mapping of the request option name mapping to a\n  function that applies the option value to a request.\n* Removed the concept of \"throwImmediately\" from exceptions and error events.\n  This control mechanism was used to stop a transfer of concurrent requests\n  from completing. This can now be handled by throwing the exception or by\n  cancelling a pool of requests or each outstanding future request individually.\n* Updated to \"GuzzleHttp\\Streams\" 3.0.\n    * `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\StreamInterface::getContents()` no longer accepts a\n      `maxLen` parameter. This update makes the Guzzle streams project\n      compatible with the current PSR-7 proposal.\n    * `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Stream::__construct`,\n      `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Stream::factory`, and\n      `GuzzleHttp\\Stream\\Utils::create` no longer accept a size in the second\n      argument. They now accept an associative array of options, including the\n      \"size\" key and \"metadata\" key which can be used to provide custom metadata.\n\n## 4.2.2 - 2014-09-08\n\n* Fixed a memory leak in the CurlAdapter when reusing cURL handles.\n* No longer using `request_fulluri` in stream adapter proxies.\n* Relative redirects are now based on the last response, not the first response.\n\n## 4.2.1 - 2014-08-19\n\n* Ensuring that the StreamAdapter does not always add a Content-Type header\n* Adding automated github releases with a phar and zip\n\n## 4.2.0 - 2014-08-17\n\n* Now merging in default options using a case-insensitive comparison.\n  Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/767\n* Added the ability to automatically decode `Content-Encoding` response bodies\n  using the `decode_content` request option. This is set to `true` by default\n  to decode the response body if it comes over the wire with a\n  `Content-Encoding`. Set this value to `false` to disable decoding the\n  response content, and pass a string to provide a request `Accept-Encoding`\n  header and turn on automatic response decoding. This feature now allows you\n  to pass an `Accept-Encoding` header in the headers of a request but still\n  disable automatic response decoding.\n  Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/764\n* Added the ability to throw an exception immediately when transferring\n  requests in parallel. Closes https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/760\n* Updating guzzlehttp/streams dependency to ~2.1\n* No longer utilizing the now deprecated namespaced methods from the stream\n  package.\n\n## 4.1.8 - 2014-08-14\n\n* Fixed an issue in the CurlFactory that caused setting the `stream=false`\n  request option to throw an exception.\n  See: https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/769\n* TransactionIterator now calls rewind on the inner iterator.\n  See: https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/765\n* You can now set the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`\n  when creating POST requests to force multipart bodies.\n  See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/768\n\n## 4.1.7 - 2014-08-07\n\n* Fixed an error in the HistoryPlugin that caused the same request and response\n  to be logged multiple times when an HTTP protocol error occurs.\n* Ensuring that cURL does not add a default Content-Type when no Content-Type\n  has been supplied by the user. This prevents the adapter layer from modifying\n  the request that is sent over the wire after any listeners may have already\n  put the request in a desired state (e.g., signed the request).\n* Throwing an exception when you attempt to send requests that have the\n  \"stream\" set to true in parallel using the MultiAdapter.\n* Only calling curl_multi_select when there are active cURL handles. This was\n  previously changed and caused performance problems on some systems due to PHP\n  always selecting until the maximum select timeout.\n* Fixed a bug where multipart/form-data POST fields were not correctly\n  aggregated (e.g., values with \"&\").\n\n## 4.1.6 - 2014-08-03\n\n* Added helper methods to make it easier to represent messages as strings,\n  including getting the start line and getting headers as a string.\n\n## 4.1.5 - 2014-08-02\n\n* Automatically retrying cURL \"Connection died, retrying a fresh connect\"\n  errors when possible.\n* cURL implementation cleanup\n* Allowing multiple event subscriber listeners to be registered per event by\n  passing an array of arrays of listener configuration.\n\n## 4.1.4 - 2014-07-22\n\n* Fixed a bug that caused multi-part POST requests with more than one field to\n  serialize incorrectly.\n* Paths can now be set to \"0\"\n* `ResponseInterface::xml` now accepts a `libxml_options` option and added a\n  missing default argument that was required when parsing XML response bodies.\n* A `save_to` stream is now created lazily, which means that files are not\n  created on disk unless a request succeeds.\n\n## 4.1.3 - 2014-07-15\n\n* Various fixes to multipart/form-data POST uploads\n* Wrapping function.php in an if-statement to ensure Guzzle can be used\n  globally and in a Composer install\n* Fixed an issue with generating and merging in events to an event array\n* POST headers are only applied before sending a request to allow you to change\n  the query aggregator used before uploading\n* Added much more robust query string parsing\n* Fixed various parsing and normalization issues with URLs\n* Fixing an issue where multi-valued headers were not being utilized correctly\n  in the StreamAdapter\n\n## 4.1.2 - 2014-06-18\n\n* Added support for sending payloads with GET requests\n\n## 4.1.1 - 2014-06-08\n\n* Fixed an issue related to using custom message factory options in subclasses\n* Fixed an issue with nested form fields in a multi-part POST\n* Fixed an issue with using the `json` request option for POST requests\n* Added `ToArrayInterface` to `GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\CookieJar`\n\n## 4.1.0 - 2014-05-27\n\n* Added a `json` request option to easily serialize JSON payloads.\n* Added a `GuzzleHttp\\json_decode()` wrapper to safely parse JSON.\n* Added `setPort()` and `getPort()` to `GuzzleHttp\\Message\\RequestInterface`.\n* Added the ability to provide an emitter to a client in the client constructor.\n* Added the ability to persist a cookie session using $_SESSION.\n* Added a trait that can be used to add event listeners to an iterator.\n* Removed request method constants from RequestInterface.\n* Fixed warning when invalid request start-lines are received.\n* Updated MessageFactory to work with custom request option methods.\n* Updated cacert bundle to latest build.\n\n4.0.2 (2014-04-16)\n------------------\n\n* Proxy requests using the StreamAdapter now properly use request_fulluri (#632)\n* Added the ability to set scalars as POST fields (#628)\n\n## 4.0.1 - 2014-04-04\n\n* The HTTP status code of a response is now set as the exception code of\n  RequestException objects.\n* 303 redirects will now correctly switch from POST to GET requests.\n* The default parallel adapter of a client now correctly uses the MultiAdapter.\n* HasDataTrait now initializes the internal data array as an empty array so\n  that the toArray() method always returns an array.\n\n## 4.0.0 - 2014-03-29\n\n* For information on changes and upgrading, see:\n  https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/blob/master/UPGRADING.md#3x-to-40\n* Added `GuzzleHttp\\batch()` as a convenience function for sending requests in\n  parallel without needing to write asynchronous code.\n* Restructured how events are added to `GuzzleHttp\\ClientInterface::sendAll()`.\n  You can now pass a callable or an array of associative arrays where each\n  associative array contains the \"fn\", \"priority\", and \"once\" keys.\n\n## 4.0.0.rc-2 - 2014-03-25\n\n* Removed `getConfig()` and `setConfig()` from clients to avoid confusion\n  around whether things like base_url, message_factory, etc. should be able to\n  be retrieved or modified.\n* Added `getDefaultOption()` and `setDefaultOption()` to ClientInterface\n* functions.php functions were renamed using snake_case to match PHP idioms\n* Added support for `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and\n  `GUZZLE_CURL_SELECT_TIMEOUT` environment variables\n* Added the ability to specify custom `sendAll()` event priorities\n* Added the ability to specify custom stream context options to the stream\n  adapter.\n* Added a functions.php function for `get_path()` and `set_path()`\n* CurlAdapter and MultiAdapter now use a callable to generate curl resources\n* MockAdapter now properly reads a body and emits a `headers` event\n* Updated Url class to check if a scheme and host are set before adding \":\"\n  and \"//\". This allows empty Url (e.g., \"\") to be serialized as \"\".\n* Parsing invalid XML no longer emits warnings\n* Curl classes now properly throw AdapterExceptions\n* Various performance optimizations\n* Streams are created with the faster `Stream\\create()` function\n* Marked deprecation_proxy() as internal\n* Test server is now a collection of static methods on a class\n\n## 4.0.0-rc.1 - 2014-03-15\n\n* See https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/blob/master/UPGRADING.md#3x-to-40\n\n## 3.8.1 - 2014-01-28\n\n* Bug: Always using GET requests when redirecting from a 303 response\n* Bug: CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST is now correctly set to false when setting `$certificateAuthority` to false in\n  `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::setSslVerification()`\n* Bug: RedirectPlugin now uses strict RFC 3986 compliance when combining a base URL with a relative URL\n* Bug: The body of a request can now be set to `\"0\"`\n* Sending PHP stream requests no longer forces `HTTP/1.0`\n* Adding more information to ExceptionCollection exceptions so that users have more context, including a stack trace of\n  each sub-exception\n* Updated the `$ref` attribute in service descriptions to merge over any existing parameters of a schema (rather than\n  clobbering everything).\n* Merging URLs will now use the query string object from the relative URL (thus allowing custom query aggregators)\n* Query strings are now parsed in a way that they do no convert empty keys with no value to have a dangling `=`.\n  For example `foo&bar=baz` is now correctly parsed and recognized as `foo&bar=baz` rather than `foo=&bar=baz`.\n* Now properly escaping the regular expression delimiter when matching Cookie domains.\n* Network access is now disabled when loading XML documents\n\n## 3.8.0 - 2013-12-05\n\n* Added the ability to define a POST name for a file\n* JSON response parsing now properly walks additionalProperties\n* cURL error code 18 is now retried automatically in the BackoffPlugin\n* Fixed a cURL error when URLs contain fragments\n* Fixed an issue in the BackoffPlugin retry event where it was trying to access all exceptions as if they were\n  CurlExceptions\n* CURLOPT_PROGRESS function fix for PHP 5.5 (69fcc1e)\n* Added the ability for Guzzle to work with older versions of cURL that do not support `CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS`\n* Fixed a bug that was encountered when parsing empty header parameters\n* UriTemplate now has a `setRegex()` method to match the docs\n* The `debug` request parameter now checks if it is truthy rather than if it exists\n* Setting the `debug` request parameter to true shows verbose cURL output instead of using the LogPlugin\n* Added the ability to combine URLs using strict RFC 3986 compliance\n* Command objects can now return the validation errors encountered by the command\n* Various fixes to cache revalidation (#437 and 29797e5)\n* Various fixes to the AsyncPlugin\n* Cleaned up build scripts\n\n## 3.7.4 - 2013-10-02\n\n* Bug fix: 0 is now an allowed value in a description parameter that has a default value (#430)\n* Bug fix: SchemaFormatter now returns an integer when formatting to a Unix timestamp\n  (see https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/147)\n* Bug fix: Cleaned up and fixed URL dot segment removal to properly resolve internal dots\n* Minimum PHP version is now properly specified as 5.3.3 (up from 5.3.2) (#420)\n* Updated the bundled cacert.pem (#419)\n* OauthPlugin now supports adding authentication to headers or query string (#425)\n\n## 3.7.3 - 2013-09-08\n\n* Added the ability to get the exception associated with a request/command when using `MultiTransferException` and\n  `CommandTransferException`.\n* Setting `additionalParameters` of a response to false is now honored when parsing responses with a service description\n* Schemas are only injected into response models when explicitly configured.\n* No longer guessing Content-Type based on the path of a request.

You can pass a 'request.options' configuration setting to a client to apply default request options to\n  every request created by a client (e.g. default query string variables, headers, curl options, etc.).\n* Added a static facade class that allows you to use Guzzle with static methods and mount the class to `\\Guzzle`.\n  See `Guzzle\\Http\\StaticClient::mount`.\n* Added `command.request_options` to `Guzzle\\Service\\Command\\AbstractCommand` to pass request options to requests\n      created by a command (e.g. custom headers, query string variables, timeout settings, etc.).\n* Stream size in `Guzzle\\Stream\\PhpStreamRequestFactory` will now be set if Content-Length is returned in the\n  headers of a response\n* Added `Guzzle\\Common\\Collection::setPath($path, $value)` to set a value into an array using a nested key\n  (e.g. `$collection->setPath('foo/baz/bar', 'test'); echo $collection['foo']['bar']['bar'];`)\n* ServiceBuilders now support storing and retrieving arbitrary data\n* CachePlugin can now purge all resources for a given URI\n* CachePlugin can automatically purge matching cached items when a non-idempotent request is sent to a resource\n* CachePlugin now uses the Vary header to determine if a resource is a cache hit\n* `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Response` now implements `\\Serializable`\n* Added `Guzzle\\Cache\\CacheAdapterFactory::fromCache()` to more easily create cache adapters\n* `Guzzle\\Service\\ClientInterface::execute()` now accepts an array, single command, or Traversable\n* Fixed a bug in `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Header\\Link::addLink()`\n* Better handling of calculating the size of a stream in `Guzzle\\Stream\\Stream` using fstat() and caching the size\n* `Guzzle\\Common\\Exception\\ExceptionCollection` now creates a more readable exception message\n* Fixing BC break: Added back the MonologLogAdapter implementation rather than extending from PsrLog so that older\n  Symfony users can still use the old version of Monolog.\n* Fixing BC break: Added the implementation back in for `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\AbstractMessage::getTokenizedHeader()`.\n  Now triggering an E_USER_DEPRECATED warning when used. Use `$message->getHeader()->parseParams()`.\n* Several performance improvements to `Guzzle\\Common\\Collection`\n* Added an `$options` argument to the end of the following methods of `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface`:\n  createRequest, head, delete, put, patch, post, options, prepareRequest\n* Added an `$options` argument to the end of `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request\\RequestFactoryInterface::createRequest()`\n* Added an `applyOptions()` method to `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request\\RequestFactoryInterface`\n* Changed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::get($uri = null, $headers = null, $body = null)` to\n  `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::get($uri = null, $headers = null, $options = array())`. You can still pass in a\n  resource, string, or EntityBody into the $options parameter to specify the download location of the response.\n* Changed `Guzzle\\Common\\Collection::__construct($data)` to no longer accepts a null value for `$data` but a\n  default `array()`\n* Added `Guzzle\\Stream\\StreamInterface::isRepeatable`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::setDefaultHeaders(). Use\n  $client->getConfig()->setPath('request.options/headers/{header_name}', 'value')`. or\n  $client->getConfig()->setPath('request.options/headers', array('header_name' => 'value'))`.\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::getDefaultHeaders(). Use $client->getConfig()->getPath('request.options/headers')`.\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::expandTemplate()`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::setRequestFactory()`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\ClientInterface::getCurlMulti()`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface::canCache`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface::setIsRedirect`\n* Removed `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\RequestInterface::isRedirect`\n* Made `Guzzle\\Http\\Client::expandTemplate` and `getUriTemplate` protected methods.\n* You can now enable E_USER_DEPRECATED warnings to see if you are using a deprecated method by setting\n  `Guzzle\\Common\\Version::$emitWarnings` to true.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::isResponseBodyRepeatable()` as deprecated. Use\n      `$request->getResponseBody()->isRepeatable()` instead.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::canCache()` as deprecated. Use\n  `Guzzle\\Plugin\\Cache\\DefaultCanCacheStrategy->canCacheRequest()` instead.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Http\\Message\\Request::canCache()` as deprecated.

Use [request.options][params].\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Service\\Client::enableMagicMethods()` as deprecated. Magic methods can no longer be disabled on a Guzzle\\Service\\Client.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Service\\Client::getDefaultHeaders()` as deprecated. Use $client->getConfig()->getPath('request.options/headers')`.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Service\\Client::setDefaultHeaders()` as deprecated. Use $client->getConfig()->setPath('request.options/headers/{header_name}', 'value')`.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Parser\\Url\\UrlParser` as deprecated. Just use PHP's `parse_url()` and percent encode your UTF-8.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Common\\Collection::inject()` as deprecated.\n* Marked `Guzzle\\Plugin\\CurlAuth\\CurlAuthPlugin` as deprecated. Use `$client->getConfig()->setPath('request.options/auth', array('user', 'pass', 'Basic|Digest');`\n* CacheKeyProviderInterface and DefaultCacheKeyProvider are no longer used. All of this logic is handled in a\n  CacheStorageInterface. These two objects and interface will be removed in a future version.\n* Always setting X-cache headers on cached responses\n* Default cache TTLs are now handled by the CacheStorageInterface of a CachePlugin\n* `CacheStorageInterface::cache($key, Response $response, $ttl = null)` has changed to `cache(RequestInterface\n  $request, Response $response);`\n* `CacheStorageInterface::fetch($key)` has changed to `fetch(RequestInterface $request);`\n* `CacheStorageInterface::delete($key)` has changed to `delete(RequestInterface $request);`\n* Added `CacheStorageInterface::purge($url)`\n* `DefaultRevalidation::__construct(CacheKeyProviderInterface $cacheKey, CacheStorageInterface $cache, CachePlugin\n  $plugin)` has changed to `DefaultRevalidation::__construct(CacheStorageInterface $cache,\n  CanCacheStrategyInterface $canCache = null)`\n* Added `RevalidationInterface::shouldRevalidate(RequestInterface $request, Response $response)`\n\n## 3.6.0 - 2013-05-29\n\n* ServiceDescription now implements ToArrayInterface\n* Added command.hidden_params to blacklist certain headers from being treated as additionalParameters\n* Guzzle can now correctly parse incomplete URLs\n* Mixed casing of headers are now forced to be a single consistent casing across all values for that header.\n* Messages internally use a HeaderCollection object to delegate handling case-insensitive header resolution\n* Removed the whole changedHeader() function system of messages because all header changes now go through addHeader().\n* Specific header implementations can be created for complex headers.

This allows you\n  to utilize other PSR-7 compatible libraries with Guzzle.\n- Supports PSR-18 allowing interoperability between other PSR-18 HTTP Clients.\n- Abstracts away the underlying HTTP transport, allowing you to write\n  environment and transport agnostic code; i.e., no hard dependency on cURL,\n  PHP streams, sockets, or non-blocking event loops.\n- Middleware system allows you to augment and compose client behavior.\n\n```php\n$client = new \\GuzzleHttp\\Client();\n$response = $client->request('GET', 'https://api.github.com/repos/guzzle/guzzle');\n\necho $response->getStatusCode(); // 200\necho $response->getHeaderLine('content-type'); // 'application/json; charset=utf8'\necho $response->getBody(); // '{\"id\": 1420053, \"name\": \"guzzle\", ...}'\n\n// Send an asynchronous request.\n$request = new \\GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\Request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org');\n$promise = $client->sendAsync($request)->then(function ($response) {\n    echo 'I completed!
