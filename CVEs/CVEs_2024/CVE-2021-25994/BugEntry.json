For the next version, we can try to implement some real multi-factor authentication.\n- When a user creates another user, they don't need to set a password.  Instead, an email is sent out to the new user, with a token allowing them to set their own password.\n- Admins can manually generate a password reset request for another user, or directly change the user's password.\n\n## v0.3.0\n- [Autoloading with Composer](https://v3.userfrosting.com/navigating/#composer)\n- [MVC Architecture](https://v3.userfrosting.com/navigating/#structure)\n- [Front Controllers and the Slim Microframework](https://v3.userfrosting.com/navigating/#slim)\n- [Twig - Templating](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)\n- [Theming](https://v3.userfrosting.com/components/#theming)\n- [Plugins](https://v3.userfrosting.com/components/#plugins)\n\n## v0.2.1\n- Implemented db-driven menu system.  Menu items are pulled from the database, and can be modified via plugins.\n- Implemented backend templating of forms and tables via [Bootsole](https://github.com/alexweissman/bootsole).\n\n## v0.2.0 (butterflyknife)\n- Converted all DB calls to PDO.\n- Renamed \"permissions\" to \"groups\".  Same concept, but using the word \"group\" suggests that it can be used for more than just access control.\n- Implemented \"primary group\" membership for users.  A user can belong to multiple groups, but only one of those will be their primary group.\n- Implemented DB-driven home pages for groups.  Upon login, a user will be redirected to the `home_page` for their primary group.\n- Implemented templated menus.  Every group has a corresponding menu template in `models/menu-templates`.  Upon login, the menu for a user's primary group is automatically loaded and rendered.\n- Implemented function-level user authorization.  Whenever a function in `secure_functions` is called, the `user_action_permits` table is checked to see whether or not that user has access to the function (the `action` column), conditional on the boolean functions specified in the `permits` column.\n- Organized pages into four categories: account pages, API pages, form pages, and public pages.  Public pages reside in the root directory and can be accessed by anyone.  Account pages are in the `account` directory and are only accessible after logging in.  API pages are in the `api` directory, and consist of all the pages that process or fetch data from the DB and interact with the frontend via AJAX/JSON.  They are accessible by any logged in user, but will only perform a function if the user is authorized.  Form pages are in the `forms` directory, and consist of pages that generate forms (for creating/updating users, groups, etc.)\n- Converted registration page to AJAX.\n- Improved installer with site configuration.\n\n## v0.1.7\n- Page scrolls back to top after AJAX submit.\n- \"Website url\" is automatically suffixed with \"/\" if necessary.\n- Fixed bad link to forgot_password.php.\n- Began implementing action authorization scheme.\n\n## v0.1.6\n- Implemented CSRF token checking for creating and updating users\n- Moved much of the nuts and bolts for generating the user-create and user-update forms to the server side, so as to streamline rendering process and require fewer requests by the client (see load_form_user.php)\n- Improved responsive layout for rendering nicely on mobile devices\n\n## v0.1.5\n- More improvements to error-handling/rendering\n- HTTPS/SSL compatible\n- Fixed bug with different table name prefixes\n- Improvements to CSRF tokens\n\n## v0.1.4\n- Updated password hashing from md5 to modern bcrypt (more secure) - thanks to contributor @r3wt\n- Included better functions for sanitizing user input, validating user ip, generating csrf (cross-site request forgery) tokens - thanks to contributor @r3wt\n\n## v0.1.3\n- Root account (user id = 1) : created upon installation, cannot be deleted or disabled.\n- Special color scheme for when logged in as root user.\n- Installer now guides user through creation of root account\n- Moved common JS and CSS includes to \"includes.php\"\n\n## v0.1.2\n- Improved error and exception handling\n- Added 404 error page\n- Standardized JSON interface for backend scripts\n- Front-end should now be able to catch virtually any backend error and take an appropriate action (instead of white screen of death)\n\n[#653]: https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/issues/653\n[#713]: https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/issues/713\n[#718]:

For example, `equals(self.group_id,2)` would have returned false for users in group 2, because it was interpreting `2` as a string and then performing its strict comparison.  It now (correctly) returns true.

It is more likely that an attacker would know the user's username, than the user themselves.  For the next version, we can try to implement some real multi-factor authentication.\n- When a user creates another user, they don't need to set a password.  Instead, an email is sent out to the new user, with a token allowing them to set their own password.\n- Admins can manually generate a password reset request for another user, or directly change the user's password.\n\n## v0.3.0\n- [Autoloading with Composer](https://v3.userfrosting.com/navigating/#composer)\n- [MVC Architecture](https://v3.userfrosting.com/navigating/#structure)\n- [Front Controllers and the Slim Microframework](https://v3.userfrosting.com/navigating/#slim)\n- [Twig - Templating](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)\n- [Theming](https://v3.userfrosting.com/components/#theming)\n- [Plugins](https://v3.userfrosting.com/components/#plugins)\n\n## v0.2.1\n- Implemented db-driven menu system.  Menu items are pulled from the database, and can be modified via plugins.\n- Implemented backend templating of forms and tables via [Bootsole](https://github.com/alexweissman/bootsole).\n\n## v0.2.0 (butterflyknife)\n- Converted all DB calls to PDO.\n- Renamed \"permissions\" to \"groups\".  Same concept, but using the word \"group\" suggests that it can be used for more than just access control.\n- Implemented \"primary group\" membership for users.  A user can belong to multiple groups, but only one of those will be their primary group.\n- Implemented DB-driven home pages for groups.  Upon login, a user will be redirected to the `home_page` for their primary group.\n- Implemented templated menus.  Every group has a corresponding menu template in `models/menu-templates`.  Upon login, the menu for a user's primary group is automatically loaded and rendered.\n- Implemented function-level user authorization.  Whenever a function in `secure_functions` is called, the `user_action_permits` table is checked to see whether or not that user has access to the function (the `action` column), conditional on the boolean functions specified in the `permits` column.\n- Organized pages into four categories: account pages, API pages, form pages, and public pages.  Public pages reside in the root directory and can be accessed by anyone.  Account pages are in the `account` directory and are only accessible after logging in.  API pages are in the `api` directory, and consist of all the pages that process or fetch data from the DB and interact with the frontend via AJAX/JSON.  They are accessible by any logged in user, but will only perform a function if the user is authorized.  Form pages are in the `forms` directory, and consist of pages that generate forms (for creating/updating users, groups, etc.)\n- Converted registration page to AJAX.\n- Improved installer with site configuration.\n\n## v0.1.7\n- Page scrolls back to top after AJAX submit.\n- \"Website url\" is automatically suffixed with \"/\" if necessary.\n- Fixed bad link to forgot_password.php.\n- Began implementing action authorization scheme.\n\n## v0.1.6\n- Implemented CSRF token checking for creating and updating users\n- Moved much of the nuts and bolts for generating the user-create and user-update forms to the server side, so as to streamline rendering process and require fewer requests by the client (see load_form_user.php)\n- Improved responsive layout for rendering nicely on mobile devices\n\n## v0.1.5\n- More improvements to error-handling/rendering\n- HTTPS/SSL compatible\n- Fixed bug with different table name prefixes\n- Improvements to CSRF tokens\n\n## v0.1.4\n- Updated password hashing from md5 to modern bcrypt (more secure) - thanks to contributor @r3wt\n- Included better functions for sanitizing user input, validating user ip, generating csrf (cross-site request forgery) tokens - thanks to contributor @r3wt\n\n## v0.1.3\n- Root account (user id = 1) : created upon installation, cannot be deleted or disabled.\n- Special color scheme for when logged in as root user.\n- Installer now guides user through creation of root account\n- Moved common JS and CSS includes to \"includes.php\"\n\n## v0.1.2\n- Improved error and exception handling\n- Added 404 error page\n- Standardized JSON interface for backend scripts\n- Front-end should now be able to catch virtually any backend error and take an appropriate action (instead of white screen of death)\n\n[#653]: https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/issues/653\n[#713]: https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting/issues/713\n[#718]:
