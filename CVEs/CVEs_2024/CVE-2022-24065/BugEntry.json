Thanks\nto [@benjixx](https://github.com/benjixx/).\n* Can now prompt the user to enter values during generation from a local cookiecutter, thanks to [@ThomasChiroux](https://github.com/ThomasChiroux/). This is now always the default behavior. Prompts can also be suppressed with ```--no-input```.\n* Your cloned cookiecutters are stored by default in your ~/.cookiecutters/ directory (or Windows equivalent). The location is configurable. (This is a major change from the pre-0.7.0 behavior, where cloned cookiecutters were deleted at the end of project generation.) Thanks [@raphigaziano](https://github.com/raphigaziano/).\n* User config in a \\~/.cookiecutterrc file, thanks to [@raphigaziano](https://github.com/raphigaziano/).

Hooks are Python or shell scripts that run before and/or after your project is generated.\n* Support for absolute paths to cookiecutters, thanks to [@krallin](https://github.com/krallin/).\n* Support for Mercurial version control system, thanks to [@pokoli](https://github.com/pokoli/).\n* When a cookiecutter contains invalid Jinja2 syntax, you get a better message that shows the location of the TemplateSyntaxError. Thanks\nto [@benjixx](https://github.com/benjixx/).\n* Can now prompt the user to enter values during generation from a local cookiecutter, thanks to [@ThomasChiroux](https://github.com/ThomasChiroux/). This is now always the default behavior. Prompts can also be suppressed with ```--no-input```.\n* Your cloned cookiecutters are stored by default in your ~/.cookiecutters/ directory (or Windows equivalent). The location is configurable. (This is a major change from the pre-0.7.0 behavior, where cloned cookiecutters were deleted at the end of project generation.) Thanks [@raphigaziano](https://github.com/raphigaziano/).\n* User config in a \\~/.cookiecutterrc file, thanks to [@raphigaziano](https://github.com/raphigaziano/).

Thanks to [@pydanny](https://github.com/pydanny), who collaborated on this with me.\n\nOther changes:\n\n* Quite a bit of refactoring and API changes.\n* Lots of documentation improvements. Thanks [@sloria](https://github.com/sloria/), [@alex](https://github.com/alex/), [@pydanny](https://github.com/pydanny), [@freakboy3742](https://github.com/freakboy3742), [@es128](https://github.com/es128/), [@rolo](https://github.com/rolo/).\n* Better naming and organization of test suite.\n* A CookiecutterCleanSystemTestCase to use for unit tests affected by the user\\'s config and cookiecutters directory.\n* Improvements to the project\\'s Makefile.\n* Improvements to tests. Thanks [@gperetin](https://github.com/gperetin/), [@s-m-i-t-a](https://github.com/s-m-i-t-a/).\n* Removal of subprocess32 dependency. Now using non-context manager version of subprocess.Popen for Python 2 compatibility.\n* Removal of cookiecutter\\'s cleanup module.\n* A bit of setup.py cleanup, thanks to [@oubiga](https://github.com/oubiga/).\n* Now depends on binaryornot 0.2.0.\n\n## 0.6.4 (2013-08-21)\n\n* Windows support officially added.\n* Fix TemplateNotFound Exception on Windows (#37).\n\n## 0.6.3 (2013-08-20)\n\n* Fix copying of binary files in nested paths (#41), thanks to [@sloria](https://github.com/sloria/).\n\n## 0.6.2 (2013-08-19)\n\n* Depend on Jinja2\\>=2.4 instead of Jinja2==2.7.\n* Fix errors on attempt to render binary files. Copy them over from the project template without rendering.\n* Fix Python 2.6/2.7 UnicodeDecodeError when values containing Unicode chars are in cookiecutter.json.\n* Set encoding in Python 3 unicode_open() to always be utf-8.\n\n## 0.6.1 (2013-08-12)\n\n* Improved project template finding. Now looks for the occurrence of {{,cookiecutter, and }} in a directory name.\n* Fix help message for input_dir arg at command prompt.\n* Minor edge cases found and corrected, as a result of improved test coverage.\n\n## 0.6.0 (2013-08-08)\n\n* Config is now in a single ```cookiecutter.json``` instead of in ```json/```.\n* When you create a project from a git repo template, Cookiecutter prompts you to enter custom values for the fields defined in ```cookiecutter.json```.\n\n## 0.5 (2013-07-28)\n\n* Friendlier, more simplified command line usage:\n\n```bash\n    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template\n    $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/\n    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template\n    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git\n```\n\n* Can now use Cookiecutter from Python as a package:\n\n```python\n    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter\n\n    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template\n    cookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')\n\n    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template\n    cookiecutter('https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git')\n```\n\n* Internal refactor to remove any code that changes the working\n    directory.\n\n## 0.4 (2013-07-22)\n\n* Only takes in one argument now: the input directory. The output directory is generated by rendering the name of the input directory.\n* Output directory cannot be the same as input directory.\n\n## 0.3 (2013-07-17)\n\n* Takes in command line args for the input and output directories.\n\n## 0.2.1 (2013-07-17)\n\n* Minor cleanup.\n\n## 0.2 (2013-07-17)\n\nBumped to \"Development Status :: 3 - Alpha\".\n\n* Works with any type of text file.\n* Directory names and filenames can be templated.\n\n## 0.1.0 (2013-07-11)\n\n* First release on PyPI.\n", "\"\"\"Helper functions for working with version control systems.\"\"\"\nimport logging\nimport os\nimport subprocess  #
