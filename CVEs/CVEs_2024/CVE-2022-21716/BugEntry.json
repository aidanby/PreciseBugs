This was a regression introduced with the migration to Python 3 in which the builtin `min` function no longer accepts `None` as an argument. (#9660)\n- twisted.conch.ssh.transport.SSHTransportBase now disconnects the remote peer if the\n  SSH version string is not sent in the first 4096 bytes. (#10284, CVE-2022-21716,\n  GHSA-rv6r-3f5q-9rgx)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Add type annotations for twisted.web.http.Request.getHeader. (#10270)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Support for Python 3.6, which is EoL as of 2021-09-04, has been deprecated.

(#10236)\n- The type annotation of the host parameter to twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorTCP.connectTCP has been corrected from bytes to str. (#10251)\n- Deprecated ``twisted.python.threading.ThreadPool.currentThread()`` in favor of ``threading.current_thread()``.\n  Switched ``twisted.python.threading.ThreadPool.currentThread()`` and ``twisted.python.threadable.getThreadID()`` to use `threading.current_thread()`` to avoid the deprecation warnings introduced for ``threading.currentThread()`` in Python 3.10. (#10273)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- twisted.internet.utils.runWithWarningsSupressed behavior of waiting on deferreds has been documented. (#10238)\n- Sync API docs templates with pydoctor 21.9.0 release, using new theming capabilities. (#10267)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #1681, #9944, #10198, #10218, #10219, #10228, #10229, #10234, #10239, #10240, #10245, #10246, #10248, #10250, #10255, #10277, #10288, #10292\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- SSHTransportBase.ssh_KEXINIT now uses the remote peer preferred MAC list for negotiation.

(#10266)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.conch now uses constant-time comparisons for MACs. (#8199)\n- twisted.conch.ssh.filetransfer.FileTransferServer will now return an ENOENT error status if an SFTP client tries to close an unrecognized file handle. (#10293)\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.client.RedirectAgent and twisted.web.client.BrowserLikeRedirectAgent now properly remove sensitive headers when redirecting to a different origin. (#10294)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Add type annotations for twisted.web.client.readBody. (#10269)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.client.getPage, twisted.web.client.downladPage, and the associated implementation classes (HTTPPageGetter, HTTPPageDownloader, HTTPClientFactory, HTTPDownloader) have been removed because they do not segregate cookies by domain. They were deprecated in Twisted 16.7.0 in favor of twisted.web.client.Agent. GHSA-92x2-jw7w-xvvx. (#10295)\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nWords\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nNames\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nTrial\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- trial.runner.filenameToModule now sets the correct module.__name__ and sys.modules key (#10230)\n\n\nTwisted 21.7.0 (2021-07-26)\n===========================\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Python 3.10b3 is now supported (#10224)\n- Type hinting was added to twisted.internet.defer, making this is the first release\n  of Twisted where you might reasonably be able to use mypy without your own custom\n  stub files (#10017)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- The changes to ``DelayedCall.__repr__`` and ``LoopingCall.__repr__`` from\n  21.7.0.rc1 were reverted as the wrong assumption that ``__qualname__`` is\n  available on all the supported Python versions.\n  (#10235)\n- The automated release process was updated to generate and release wheel files\n  to PyPI (#10236)\n- twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks has an improved type annotation, to avoid typing errors when it is used on a function which returns a non-None result. (#10231)\n- trial.runner.filenameToModule now sets the correct ``module.__name__`` and ``sys.modules`` key (#10230)\n- twisted.internet.process can now pause and resume producing in python 3 (#9933)\n- When installing Twisted it now requires a minimum Python 3.6.7 version to match the version used with automated testing. This is the minimum Python version that we know that Twisted works with. (#10098)\n- twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor will no longer raise a TypeError like \"SelectorEventLoop required, instead got: <uvloop.Loop ...>\" (broken since 21.2.0). (#10106)\n- twisted.web.template.flatten and flattenString will no longer raise RecursionError if a large number of synchronous Deferreds are included in a document. (#10125)\n- Fix type hint for http.Request.uri (from str to bytes). (#10139)\n- twisted.web.http_headers.getRawHeaders and twisted.web.http_headers.getAllRawHeaders are now typed to return immutable sequences of header values instead of lists.\n  twisted.web.http_headers.getRawHeaders is now typed to return a non-optional value if a non-None default value is given. (#10142)\n- Fixed type hint for addr argument to twisted.internet.interfaces.buildProtocol. (#10147)\n- twisted.trial._dist.worker.LocalWorker.connectionMade now always writes the\n  log file using UTF-8 encoding.\n  In previous versions it was using the system default encoding.\n  This was causing encoding errors as the distributed trial workers are sending\n  Unicode data and the system default encoding might not always be Unicode compatible.\n  For example, it can be CP1252 on Windows. (#10157)\n- twisted.words.protocols.irc.ctcpExtract was updated to work with PYPY 3.7.4. (#10189)\n- twisted.conch.ssh.transport.SSHServerTransport and twisted.conch.ssh.transport.SSHClientTransport no longer use the hardcoded\n  SHA1 digest for non-group key exchanges. (#10203)\n- haproxy transport wrapper now returns hosts of type str for getPeer() and getHost(), as specified by IPv4Address and IPv6Address documentation. Previously it was returning bytes for the host. (#10211)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Remove dead link in twisted.internet._dumbwin32proc module docstring (#9520)\n- Sync API docs templates with pydoctor 21.2.2 release. (#10105)\n- Twisted IRC channels are now hosted by Libera.Chat. (#10213)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Python 3.5 is no longer supported. (#9958)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #9816, #9915, #10068, #10085, #10094, #10102, #10107, #10108, #10109, #10110, #10112, #10119, #10120, #10121, #10122, #10123, #10140, #10143, #10145, #10150, #10151, #10155, #10159, #10168, #10169, #10171, #10172, #10173, #10174, #10179, #10194, #10201, #10212, #10215, #10217, #11017\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #10097\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.template.renderElement() now accepts any IRequest implementer instead of only twisted.web.server.Request.\n  Add type hints to twisted.web.template. (#10184)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- The server-side HTTP/1.1 chunking implementation no longer performs quadratic work when input arrives in small chunks, preventing CPU exhaustion. (#3795)\n- twisted.web.http's chunked encoding support now rejects chunk sizes that are invalid because they look like negative hexadecimal integers. (#10130)\n- The type hint of twisted.web.server.Request.postpath is now correctly listed as Optional[List[bytes]]. This was incorrect in Twisted v21.2.0. (#10136)\n- The server-side HTTP/1.1 chunking implementation now rejects invalid chunk boundaries, preventing unbounded buffering. (#10137)\n- The server-side HTTP/1.1 chunking implementation now limits the length of the chunk size line (which includes chunk extensions) to twisted.web.http.maxChunkSizeLineLength \u2014 1 KiB \u2014 so that it may not consume an unbounded amount of memory. (#10144)\n- Calling twisted.web.server.Site now registers its expiration timeout using the reactor associated with its twisted.web.server.Site. Site now a reactor attribute via its superclass, twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory. (#10177)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #9659, #10100, #10154, #10186\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nWords\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nNames\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nTwisted 21.2.0 (2021-02-28)\n===========================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- The enableSessions argument to twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions now\n  actually enables/disables OpenSSL's session cache.  Also, due to\n  session-related bugs, it defaults to False. (#9583)\n- twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks and ensureDeferred will now associate a contextvars.Context with the coroutines they run, meaning that ContextVar objects will maintain their value within the same coroutine, similarly to asyncio Tasks. This functionality requires Python 3.7+, or the contextvars PyPI backport to be installed for Python 3.5-3.6. (#9719, #9826)\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.fromCoroutine has been added. This is similar to the existing ensureDeferred function, but is named more consistently inside Twisted and does not pass through Deferreds. (#9825)\n- trial now allows the @unittest.skipIf decorator to specify that an entire test class should be skipped. (#9829)\n- The twisted.python.deprecate.deprecatedKeywordParameter decorator can be used to mark a keyword paramater of a function or method as deprecated. (#9844)\n- Projects using Twisted can now perform type checking against a Twisted\n  installation, for example using mypy. (#9908)\n- twisted.python.util.InsensitiveDict now fully implements MutableMapping. (#9919)\n- Python 3.8 is now tested and supported. (#9955)\n- Support a coroutine function in twisted.internet.task.react (#9974)\n- PyPy 3.7 is now tested and supported. (#10093)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- twisted.web.twcgi.CGIProcessProtocol.processEnded(...) now handles an already-finished request, for example when request.connectionLost(...) was called previously. (#9468)\n- Twisted's dependency on PyHamcrest has been moved from the base package to the new \"test\" extra. Consequently the test extra must be installed for Twisted's test suite to pass. (#9509)\n- Fixed serialization of timedelta, date, and time objects in twisted.spread. (#9716)\n- twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor now raises an exception if instantiated with an event loop which is not compatible with asyncio.SelectorEventLoop. This fixes the AsyncioSelectorReactor in Python 3.8+ on Windows, where in bp-34687 the default Windows asyncio event loop was changed to ProactorEventLoop.  Applications that use AsyncioSelectorReactor on Windows with Python 3.8+ must call asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy()) before instantiating and running AsyncioSelectorReactor. (#9766)\n- twisted.internet.process.registerReapProcessHandler and ._BaseProcess.reapProcess will no longer raise a TypeError when processing a None PID (#9775)\n- INotify will close its file descriptor if a directory is automatically removed by twisted from the watchlist because it's deleted, avoiding orphaned filedescriptors. (#9777)\n- DelayedCall.reset() is now working properly with asyncioreactor (#9780)\n- AsyncioSelectorReactor.seconds() now correctly returns an epoch time. (#9787)\n- The _connDone parameter has been removed from twisted.internet.abstract.FileDescriptor.loseConnection()'s signature in order to match the signature in the base class twisted.internet._newtls.ConnectionMixin loseConnection(). (#9849)\n- The Gtk3 reactor now runs on Wayland-only sessions (#9904)\n- Descriptive error messages from twisted.internet.error are now present when running with 'python -OO'. (#9918)\n- Comparator methods such as __eq__() now always return NotImplemented for uncomparable types. (#9919)\n- When installing Twisted it now requires a minimum Python 3.5.4 version to match the version used with automated testing. This is the minimum Python version that we know that Twisted works with. (#10098)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- The narrative docs now contains the associated Twisted version and the date\n  when they were generated. (#3945)\n- The \"Writing a twistd plugin\" howto now explains how to deploy twistd plugins using Python packaging and pip (#9243)\n-  (#9868, #9873, #9874)\n- Fix a typo in \"Introduction to Deferreds\" document. (#9948)\n- The Twisted Coding Standard has been changed to refer to The Black code style for guidelines regarding whitespace and line lengths. (#9957)\n- Exempt ``__repr__``, ``__slots__`` and other ``@attrs.define`` related changes from compatibility policy. (#9982)\n- Fix many docstring mistakes flagged by new sanity checks in pydoctor. (#10021)\n- Fix a few dozen broken links to API documentation pages. (#10057)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.cred.credentials.UsernameHashedPassword is now deprecated because it doesn't hash the password, causing it to return the wrong result. (#8368)\n- twisted.news is now removed from the codebase. (This module was never installed on Python 3.) (#9782)\n- Support for Python 2.7 has been removed. Twisted now supports only Python versions 3.5/3.6/3.7. (#9790)\n- twisted.pair.ethernet.IEthernetProtocol.addProto()'s interface was changed to match the existing implementations in the Twisted source code. (#9877)\n- twisted.python.filepath.FilePath.statinfo was deprecated in Twisted 15.0.0 and has now been removed. (#9881)\n- The parameters to twisted.internet.base.ReactorBase.addSystemEventTrigger(), twisted.internet.base.ReactorBase.callWhenRunning(), twisted.internet.base.ReactorBase.callLater(), twisted.internet.task.Clock.callLater() have been renamed to match the parameters defined in the following interfaces: twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorCore, twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorTime. (#9897)\n- Functions and types in twisted.python.compat that existed to support the transition from Python 2 to 3 have been deprecated. (#9922)\n- twisted.logger.LoggingFile.softspace has been deprecated. (#10042)\n- twisted.python.win32.WindowsError and FakeWindowsError have been deprecated. (#10053)\n- twisted.mail.pop3client has been renamed to twisted.mail._pop3client, since it has always been a private implementation module. (#10054)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #5356, #6460, #6903, #6986, #7945, #9306, #9512, #9531, #9622, #9652, #9718, #9744, #9768, #9773, #9776, #9778, #9781, #9784, #9785, #9788, #9789, #9791, #9793, #9795, #9796, #9797, #9798, #9800, #9802, #9803, #9808, #9809, #9810, #9811, #9812, #9820, #9823, #9827, #9833, #9837, #9840, #9842, #9846, #9847, #9848, #9850, #9851, #9852, #9854, #9855, #9856, #9857, #9858, #9861, #9862, #9863, #9864, #9865, #9866, #9867, #9869, #9870, #9871, #9872, #9876, #9878, #9879, #9880, #9882, #9883, #9884, #9886, #9889, #9890, #9891, #9892, #9895, #9896, #9898, #9899, #9902, #9903, #9916, #9917, #9921, #9924, #9927, #9928, #9936, #9953, #9954, #9956, #9959, #9960, #9969, #9970, #9971, #9975, #9976, #9977, #9978, #9979, #9980, #9981, #9983, #9985, #9986, #9987, #9988, #9989, #9991, #9992, #9995, #9999, #10000, #10002, #10009, #10010, #10011, #10014, #10015, #10018, #10025, #10027, #10029, #10032, #10033, #10034, #10036, #10038, #10043, #10044, #10046, #10054, #10059, #10060, #10061, #10063, #10064, #10065, #10069, #10080, #10090\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.conch.ssh now supports Ed25519 keys (requires OpenSSL >= 1.1.1b).

(#9176)\n- Add optional cwd argument to twisted.runner.procmon.ProcMon.addProcess (#9287)\n- twisted.python.failure.Failure tracebacks generated by coroutines scheduled with twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred - i.e. any Deferred-awaiting coroutine - now contain fewer extraneous frames from the trampoline implementation, and correctly indicate the source of exceptions raised in other call stacks - i.e. the function that raised the exception.  In other words: if you 'await' a function that raises an exception, you'll be able to see where the error came from. (#9459)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- On UNIX-like platforms, Twisted attempts to recover from EMFILE when accepting connections on TCP and UNIX ports by shedding incoming clients.

(#4442)\n- twisted.protocols.basic.LineReceiver checks received lines' lengths against\n  its MAX_LENGTH only after receiving a complete delimiter. A line ending in a\n  multi-byte delimiter like '\\r\\n' might be split by the network, with the\n  first part arriving before the rest; previously, LineReceiver erroneously\n  disconnected if the first part, e.g. 'zzzz....\\r' exceeded MAX_LENGTH.\n  LineReceiver now checks received data against MAX_LENGTH plus the delimiter's\n  length, allowing short reads to complete a line. (#6556)\n- twisted.protocols.basic.LineOnlyReceiver disconnects the transport after\n  receiving a line that exceeds MAX_LENGTH, like LineReceiver. (#6557)\n- twisted.web.http.Request.getClientIP now returns the host part of the\n  client's address when connected over IPv6.

This fixes \"trial -j\" on Python 3. (#9264)\n- twisted.trial.runner now uses the 'importlib' module instead of the 'imp'\n  module on Python 3+. This eliminates DeprecationWarnings caused by importing\n  'imp' on Python 3. (#9275)\n- twisted.web.client.HTTP11ClientProtocol now closes the connection when the\n  server is sending a header line which is longer than he line limit of\n  twisted.protocols.basic.LineReceiver.MAX_LENGTH. (#9295)\n- twisted.python.failure now handles long stacktraces better; in particular it\n  will log tracebacks for stack overflow errors.

(#9303)\n- twisted.python.failure.Failure now raises the wrapped exception in Python3,\n  and self (Failure) n Python2 when trap() is called without a matching\n  exception (#9307)\n- Writing large amounts of data no longer implies repeated, expensive copying\n  under Python 3. Python 3's write speeds are now as fast as Python 2's.\n  (#9324)\n- twisted.protocols.postfix now properly encodes errors which are unicode\n  strings to bytes.

(#9388)\n- AsyncioSelectorReactor uses the global policy's event loop. asyncio libraries\n  that retrieve the running event loop with get_event_loop() will now receive\n  the one used by AsyncioSelectorReactor. (#9390)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- public attributes of `twisted.logger.Logger` are now documented as\n  attributes.

In addition, passwords which are encrypted with\n  SHA512 and SH256 are properly verified. This fixes running a conch server\n  with: \"twistd -n conch -d /etc/ssh/ --auth=unix\". (#9130)\n- In twisted.conch.scripts.conch, on Python 3 do not write bytes directly to\n  sys.stderr. On Python 3, this fixes remote SSH execution of a command which\n  fails.

(#5519)\n- twisted.internet.posixbase.PosixReactorBase.adoptStreamPort and\n  twisted.internet.posixbase.PosixReactorBase.adoptStreamConnection now support\n  AF_UNIX SOCK_STREAM sockets. (#5573)\n-  (#8940)\n- t.protocol.policies.TimeoutMixin.setTimeout and\n  t.protocol.policies.TimeoutProtocol.cancelTimeout (used in\n  t.protocol.policies.TimeoutFactory) no longer raise a\n  t.internet.error.AlreadyCancelled exception when calling them for an already\n  cancelled timeout. (#9131)\n- twisted.web.template.flatten now supports coroutines that yield Deferreds.\n  (#9199)\n- twisted.web.client.HTTPConnectionPool passes the repr() of the endpoint to\n  the client protocol factory, and the protocol factory adds that to its own\n  repr(). This makes logs more useful. (#9235)\n- Python 3.6 is now supported (#9240)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- twisted.python.logfile.BaseLogFile and subclasses now always open the file in\n  binary mode, and will process text as UTF-8. (#6938)\n- The `ssl:` endpoint now accepts `certKey` PEM files without trailing\n  newlines. (#7530)\n- Logger.__init__ sets the namespace to \"<unknown>\" instead of raising KeyError\n  when unable to determine the namespace from the calling context. (#7930)\n- twisted.internet._win32serialport updated to support pySerial 3.x and dropped\n  pySerial 2.x support. (#8159)\n- twisted.python.rebuild now works on Python 3. (#8213)\n- twisted.web.server.Request.notifyFinish will now once again promptly notify\n  applications of client disconnection (assuming that the client doesn't send a\n  large amount of pipelined request data) rather than waiting for the timeout;\n  this fixes a bug introduced in Twisted 16.3.0. (#8692)\n- twisted.web.guard.HTTPAuthSessionWrapper configured with\n  DigestCredentialFactory now works on both Python 2 and 3. (#9127)\n- Detect when we\u2019re being run using \u201c-m twisted\u201d or \u201c-m twisted.trial\u201d and use\n  it to build an accurate usage message. (#9133)\n- twisted.protocols.tls.TLSMemoryBIOProtocol now allows unregisterProducer to\n  be called when no producer is registered, bringing it in line with other\n  transports. (#9156)\n- twisted.web web servers no longer print tracebacks when they timeout clients\n  that do not respond to TLS CLOSE_NOTIFY messages. (#9157)\n- twisted.mail.imap4 now works on Python 3. (#9161)\n- twisted.python.shortcut now works on Python 3 in Windows. (#9170)\n- Fix traceback forwarding with inlineCallbacks on python 3. (#9175)\n- twisted.mail.imap4.MessageSet now treats * as larger than every message ID,\n  leading to more consistent and robust behavior. (#9177)\n- The following plugins can now be used on Python 3 with twistd: dns, inetd,\n  portforward, procmon, socks, and words. (#9184)\n- twisted.internet._win32serialport now uses serial.serialutil.to_bytes() to\n  provide bytes in Python 3. (#9186)\n- twisted.internet.reactor.spawnProcess() now does not fail on Python 3 in\n  Windows if passed a bytes-encoded path argument. (#9200)\n- twisted.protocols.ident now works on Python 3. (#9221)\n- Ignore PyPy's implementation differences in base object class. (#9225)\n- twisted.python.test.test_setup now passes with setuptools 36.2.1 (#9231)\n- twisted.internet._win32serialport SerialPort._clearCommError() no longer\n  raises AttributeError (#9252)\n- twisted.trial.unittest.SynchronousTestCase and\n  twisted.trial.unittest.TestCase now always run their tearDown methods, even\n  when a test method fails with an exception. They also flush all errors logged\n  by a test method before running another, ensuring the logged errors are\n  associated with their originating test method. (#9267)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Trial's documentation now directly mentions the preferred way of running\n  Trial, via \"python -m twisted.trial\". (#9052)\n- twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint and\n  twisted.internet.endpoints.TCP4Client endpoint documentation updated to\n  correctly reflect that the timeout argument takes a float as well as an int.\n  (#9151)\n- Badges at top of README now correctly render as links to respective result\n  pages on GitHub. (#9216)\n- The example code for the trial tutorial is now compatible with Python3 and\n  the current version of Twisted. (#9223)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.protocols.dict is deprecated. (#9141)\n- gpsfix.py has been removed from the examples. It uses twisted.protocols.gps\n  which was removed in Twisted 16.5.0. (#9253)\n- oscardemo.py, which illustrates the use of twisted.words.protocols.oscar, as\n  been removed. twisted.words.protocols.oscar was removed in Twisted 17.5.0.\n  (#9255)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #5949, #8566, #8650, #8944, #9159, #9160, #9162, #9196, #9219, #9228, #9229,\n  #9230, #9247, #9248, #9249, #9251, #9254, #9262, #9276, #9308\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.conch.ssh.userauth.SSHUserAuthServer now gracefully handles\n  unsupported authentication key types. (#9139)\n- twisted.conch.client.default verifyHostKey now opens /dev/tty with no buffer\n  to be compatible with Python 3. This lets the conch cli work with Python 3.\n  (#9265)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.conch.ssh._cryptography_backports has been removed in favor of using\n  int_to_bytes() and int_from_bytes() from cryptography.utils. (#9263)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #9158, #9272\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.static.File.contentTypes is now documented. (#5739)\n- twisted.web.server.Request and any Twisted web server using it now support\n  automatic fast responses to HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 OPTIONS * requests, and\n  reject any other verb using the * URL form. (#9190)\n- --add-header \"HeaderName: Value\" can be passed to twist web in order to set\n  extra headers on all responses (#9241)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.client.HTTPClientFactory(...).gotHeaders(...) now handles a wrong\n  Set-Cookie header without a traceback. (#9136)\n- twisted.python.web.http.HTTPFactory now always opens logFile in binary mode\n  and writes access logs in UTF-8, to avoid encoding issues and newline\n  differences on Windows. (#9143)\n- The code examples in \"Using the Twisted Web Client\" now work on Python 3.\n  (#9172)\n- twisted.web.server.Request and all web servers that use it now no longer send\n  a default Content-Type header on responses that do not have a body (i.e. that\n  set Content-Length: 0 or that send a 204 status code). (#9191)\n- twisted.web.http.Request and all subclasses now correctly fire Deferreds\n  returned from notifyFinish with errbacks when errors are encountered in\n  HTTP/2 streams. (#9208)\n- twisted.web.microdom, twisted.web.domhelpers, and twisted.web.sux now work on\n  Python 3. (#9222)\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Sending a list of recipients with twisted.smtp.SenderFactory has been fixed.\n  This fixes a problem found when running buildbot. (#9180)\n- twisted.mail.imap4.IMAP4Server parses empty string literals even when they\n  are the last argument to a command, such as LOGIN. (#9207)\n\n\nWords\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.words.tap has been ported to Python 3 (#9169)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #9246\n\n\nNames\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Queries for unknown record types no longer incorrectly result in a server\n  error. (#9095)\n- Failed TCP connections for AFXR queries no longer raise an AttributeError.\n  (#9174)\n\n\nTwisted 17.5.0 (2017-06-04)\n===========================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- spawnProcess no longer opens an unwanted console on Windows (#5726)\n- The transition to the hyperlink package adds IPv6 support to\n  twisted.python.url.URL. This is now deprecated and new code should use\n  hyperlink directly (see #9126). (#8069)\n- twisted.logger now buffers only 200 events by default (reduced from 65536)\n  while waiting for observers to be configured. (#8164)\n- The transition of twisted.python.url to using the hyperlink package enables a\n  URL.click() with no arguments (or 0-length string argument) to resolve dot\n  segments in the path. (#8184)\n- twisted.protocols.finger now works on Python 3. (#8230)\n- TLS-related tests now pass when run with OpenSSL 1.1.0. This makes tests pass\n  again on macOS and Windows, as cryptography 1.8 and later include OpenSSL\n  1.1.0. (#8898)\n- UNIX socket endpoints now process all messages from recvmsg's ancillary data\n  via twisted.internet.unix.Server.doRead/twisted.internet.unix.Client.doRead,\n  while discarding and logging ones that don't contain file descriptors.\n  (#8912)\n- twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint and twisted.web.client.Agent work\n  again with reactors that do not provide IReactorPluggableNameResolver. This\n  undoes the changes that broke downstream users such as treq.testing. Note\n  that passing reactors that do not provide IReactorPluggableNameResolver to\n  either is deprecated. (#9032)\n- A Python 3 Perspective Broker server which receives a remote call with\n  keyword arguments from a Python 2 client will now decode any keys which are\n  binary to strings instead of crashing. This fixes interoperability between\n  Python 2 Buildbot clients and Python 3 Buildbot servers. (#9047)\n- twisted.internet._threadedselect now works on both Python 2 and 3. (#9053)\n- twisted.internet.interfaces.IResolverSimple implementers will now always be\n  passed bytes, properly IDNA encoded if required, on Python 2. On Python 3,\n  they will now be passed correctly IDNA-encoded Unicode forms of the domain,\n  taking advantage of the idna library from PyPI if possible. This is to avoid\n  Python's standard library (which has an out of date idna module) from mis-\n  encoding domain names when non-ASCII Unicode is passed to it. (#9137)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- The examples in Twisted howto \"Using the Twisted Application Framework\",\n  section \"Customizing twistd logging\" have been updated to use latest logging\n  modules and syntax (#9084)\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.asFuture and\n  twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.fromFuture were added, allowing for easy\n  transitions between asyncio coroutines (which await Futures) and twisted\n  coroutines (which await Deferreds). (#8748)\n- twisted.application.internet.ClientService.whenConnected now accepts an\n  argument \"failAfterFailures\". If you set this to 1, the Deferred returned by\n  whenConnected will errback when the connection attempt fails, rather than\n  retrying forever. This lets you react (probably by stopping the\n  ClientService) to connection errors that are likely to be persistent, such as\n  using the wrong hostname, or not being connected to the internet at all.\n  (#9116)\n- twisted.protocols.tls.TLSMemoryBIOProtocol and anything that uses it\n  indirectly including the TLS client and server endpoints now enables TLS 1.3\n  cipher suites. (#9128)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #8133, #8995, #8997, #9003, #9015, #9021, #9026, #9027, #9049, #9057, #9062,\n  #9065, #9069, #9070, #9072, #9074, #9075, #9111, #9117, #9140, #9144, #9145\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.runner.inetdconf.InvalidRPCServicesConfError,\n  twisted.runner.inetdconf.RPCServicesConf, twisted.runner.inetdtap.RPCServer,\n  and twisted.runner.portmap, deprecated since 16.2.0, have been removed.\n  (#8464)\n- twisted.python.url and twisted.python._url were modified to rely on\n  hyperlink, a new package based on the Twisted URL implementation. Hyperlink\n  adds support for IPv6 (fixing #8069), correct username/password encoding,\n  better scheme/netloc inference, improved URL.click() behavior (fixing #8184),\n  and more. For full docs see hyperlink.readthedocs.io and the CHANGELOG in the\n  hyperlink GitHub repo. (#9126)\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- History-aware terminal protocols like twisted.conch.manhole.Manhole no longer\n  raise a TypeError when a user visits a partial line they added to the command\n  line history by pressing up arrow before return. (#9031)\n- The telnet_echo.tac example had conflicting port callouts between runtime and\n  documentation. File was altered to run on documented port, 6023. (#9055)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Remove diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 from twisted.conch. See https://weakdh.org/\n  (#9019)\n- Removed small and obscure elliptic curves from conch. The only curves conch\n  supports now are the ones also supported by OpenSSH. (#9088)\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.mail.smtp has been ported to Python 3. (#8770)\n\n\nNames\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- RRHeader now converts its ttl argument to an integer, raising a TypeError if\n  it cannot. (#8340)\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.cgi now works on Python 3 (#8009)\n- twisted.web.distrib now works on Python 3 (#8010)\n- twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory now propagates its reactor's callLater method to\n  the HTTPChannel object, rather than having callLater grab the global reactor.\n  This prevents the possibility of HTTPFactory logging using one reactor, but\n  HTTPChannel running timeouts on another. (#8904)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.template.flattenString docstring now correctly references\n  io.BytesIO (rather than NativeStringIO). (#9028)\n\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.client now exposes the RequestGenerationFailed exception type.\n  (#5310)\n- twisted.web.client.Agent will now parse responses that begin with a status\n  line that is missing a phrase. (#7673)\n- twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel and twisted.web._http2.H2Connection have been\n  enhanced so that after they time out they wait a small amount of time to\n  allow the connection to close gracefully and, if it does not, they forcibly\n  close it to avoid allowing malicious clients to forcibly keep the connection\n  open. (#8902)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #8981, #9018, #9067, #9090, #9092, #9093, #9096\n\n\nWords\n-----\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.words.protocols.oscar, which is client code for Oscar/ICQ, was\n  deprecated in 16.2.0 and has now been removed. (#9024)\n\n\nTwisted Core 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - Added a new interface,\n   twisted.internet.interfaces.IHostnameResolver, which is an\n   improvement to twisted.internet.interfaces.IResolverSimple that\n   supports resolving multiple addresses as well as resolving IPv6\n   addresses.  This is a native, asynchronous, Twisted analogue to\n   getaddrinfo. (#4362)\n - twisted.web.client.Agent now uses HostnameEndpoint internally; as a\n   consequence, it now supports IPv6, as well as making connections\n   faster and more reliably to hosts that have more than one DNS name.\n   (#6712)\n - twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions now has the new constructor\n   argument 'raiseMinimumTo', allowing you to increase the minimum TLS\n   version to this version or Twisted's default, whichever is higher.\n   The additional new constructor arguments 'lowerMaximumSecurityTo'\n   and 'insecurelyLowerMinimumTo' allow finer grained control over\n   negotiated versions that don't honour Twisted's defaults, for\n   working around broken peers, at the cost of reducing the security\n   of the TLS it will negotiate. (#6800)\n - twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions now sets the OpenSSL\n   context's mode to MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS, which will free the\n   read/write buffers on idle TLS connections to save memory. (#8247)\n - trial --help-reactors will only list reactors which can be\n   imported.  (#8745)\n - twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint now uses the passed\n   reactor's implementation of\n   twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorPluggableResolver to resolve\n   hostnames rather than its own deferToThread/getaddrinfo wrapper;\n   this makes its hostname resolution pluggable via a public API.\n   (#8922)\n - twisted.internet.reactor.spawnProcess now does not emit a\n   deprecation warning on Unicode arguments. It will encode Unicode\n   arguments down to bytes using the filesystem encoding on UNIX and\n   Python 2 on Windows, and pass Unicode through unchanged on Python 3\n   on Windows. (#8941)\n - twisted.trial._dist.test.test_distreporter now works on Python 3.\n   (#8943)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - trial --help-reactors will now display iocp and win32er reactors\n   with Python 3. (#8745)\n - twisted.logger._flatten.flattenEvent now handles log_format being\n   None instead of assuming the value is always a string. (#8860)\n - twisted.protocol.ftp is now Python 3 compatible (#8865)\n - twisted.names.client.Resolver can now resolve names with IPv6 DNS\n   servers. (#8877)\n - twisted.application.internet.ClientService now waits for existing\n   connections to disconnect before trying to connect again when\n   restarting. (#8899)\n - twisted.internet.unix.Server.doRead and\n   twisted.internet.unix.Client.doRead no longer fail if recvmsg's\n   ancillary data contains more than one file descriptor. (#8911)\n - twist on Python 3 now correctly prints the help text when given no\n   plugin to run. (#8918)\n - twisted.python.sendmsg.sendmsg no longer segfaults on Linux +\n   Python 2. (#8969)\n - IHandshakeListener providers connected via SSL4ClientEndpoint will\n   now have their handshakeCompleted methods called. (#8973)\n - The twist script now respects the --reactor option. (#8983)\n - Fix crash when using SynchronousTestCase with Warning object which\n   does not store a string as its first argument (like\n   libmysqlclient). (#9005)\n - twisted.python.compat.execfile() does not open files with the\n   deprecated 'U' flag on Python 3. (#9012)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOption's 'method' constructor\n   argument is now deprecated, in favour of the new 'raiseMinimumTo',\n   'lowerMaximumSecurityTo', and 'insecurelyLowerMinimumTo' arguments.\n   (#6800)\n - twisted.protocols.telnet (not to be confused with the supported\n   twisted.conch.telnet), deprecated since Twisted 2.5, has been\n   removed. (#8925)\n - twisted.application.strports.parse, as well as the deprecated\n   default arguments in strports.service/listen, deprecated since\n   Twisted 10.2, has been removed. (#8926)\n - twisted.web.client.getPage and twisted.web.client.downloadPage have\n   been deprecated in favour of https://pypi.org/project/treq and\n   twisted.web.client.Agent.

This\n   functionality has been deprecated since 11.0. (#8920)\n\n\nTwisted Names 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n=================================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.names.authority.BindAuthority has been ported to Python 3.\n   (#8880)\n\n\nTwisted News 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Pair 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Runner 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n==================================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - On Python 3, procmon now handles process output without exceptions\n   (#8919)\n\n\nTwisted Web 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n===============================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - twisted.web.client.Agent now sets ``Content-Length: 0`` for PUT and\n   POST requests made without a body producer. (#8984)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory now times connections out after one\n   minute of no data from the client being received, before the\n   request is complete, rather than twelve hours. (#3746)\n - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel, the server class for Twisted's\n   HTTP/1.1 server, now exerts backpressure against clients that do\n   not read responses. This means that if a client stops reading from\n   a socket for long enough, Twisted will stop reading further\n   requests from that client until it consumes some responses. (#8868)\n - twisted.web.http_headers.Headers.getRawHeaders no longer attempts\n   to decode the default value when called with a unicode header name.\n   (#8974)\n - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel is less likely to leak file\n   descriptors when timing out clients using HTTPS connections. In\n   some cases it is still possible to leak a file descriptor when\n   timing out HTTP clients: further patches will address this issue.\n   (#8992)\n\nOther\n-----\n - #7744, #8909, #8935\n\n\nTwisted Words 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n=================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Core 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - The twist script can now be run by invoking python -m twisted.\n   (#8657)\n - twisted.protocols.sip has been ported to Python 3. (#8669)\n - twisted.persisted.dirdbm has been ported to Python 3. (#8888)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.internet.defer.Deferred now implements send, not __send__,\n   which means that it is now a conforming generator. (#8861)\n - The IOCP reactor no longer transmits the contents of uninitialized\n   memory when writing large amounts of data. (#8870)\n - Deferreds awaited/yielded from in a\n   twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred wrapped coroutine will now\n   properly raise exceptions. Additionally, it more closely models\n   asyncio.ensure_future and will pass through Deferreds. (#8878)\n - Deferreds that are paused or chained on other Deferreds will now\n   return a result when yielded/awaited in a twisted.internet.defer\n   .ensureDeferred-wrapped coroutine, instead of returning the\n   Deferred it was chained to. (#8890)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n - twisted.test.proto_helpers is now explicitly covered by the\n   compatibility policy.

This prevents process-related tests from hanging on\n   Windows with Python 3. (#8735)\n - Client and server TLS connections made via the client TLS endpoint\n   and the server SSL endpoint, as well as any other code that uses\n   twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions, no longer accept 3DES-\n   based cipher suites by default, to defend against SWEET32. (#8781)\n - twisted.logger.jsonFileLogObserver no longer emits non-JSON\n   tracebacks into its file; additionally,\n   twisted.logger.formatEventAsClassicLogText now includes traceback\n   information for the log event it formats. (#8858)\n - twisted.python.version now exports a version of Incremental that is\n   16.10.1 or higher, making t.p.v.Version package name comparisons\n   case-insensitive. (#8863)\n - twisted.python.reflect.safe_str encodes unicode as ascii with\n   backslashreplace error handling on Python 2. (#8864)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n - The twisted.internet.interfaces.IProtocol.dataReceived() method\n   takes one parameter of type bytes.  This has been clarified in the\n   doc string. (#8763)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - twisted.python.constants is deprecated in preference to constantly\n   on PyPI, which is the same code rolled into its own package.\n   (#7351)\n - twisted.python.dist3 has been made private API. (#8761)\n - When the source code is checked out, bin/trial is no longer in the\n   tree.  Developers working on the Twisted source code itself should\n   either (1) run all tests under tox, or (2) run 'python setup.py\n   develop' to install trial before running any tests. (#8765)\n - twisted.protocols.gps, deprecated since Twisted 15.2, has been\n   removed.

Add twisted.application.runner API,\n   currently private, which twist is built on. (#5705)\n - The new interface IHandshakeListener that can be implemented by any\n   Protocol provides a callback that is called when the TLS handshake\n   has been completed, allowing Protocols to make decisions about the\n   TLS configuration before application data is sent. (#6024)\n - twisted.python.syslog has been ported to Python 3. (#7957)\n - twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred has been added, similar to\n   asyncio's ensure_future. Wrapping a coroutine (the result of a\n   function defined using async def, available only on Python 3.5+)\n   with it allows you to use the \"await\" keyword with Deferreds inside\n   the coroutine, similar to \"yield\" when using inlineCallbacks.\n   (#8088)\n - twisted.internet.inotify have been ported to Python 3 (#8211)\n - twisted.enterprise has been ported to Python 3. The third-party\n   pysqlite2 package has not been ported to Python 3, so any database\n   connector based on pysqlite2 cannot be used. Instead the sqlite3\n   module included with Python 3 should be used. (#8303)\n - Scripts such as cftp, ckeygen, conch, mailmail, pyhtmlizer,\n   tkconch, twistd and trial have been updated to be setuptools\n   console scripts.  (#8491)\n - twisted.pair.raw and twisted.pair.rawudp have been ported to Python\n   3 (#8545)\n - twisted.internet.baseprocess has been ported to Python 3. (#8546)\n - twisted.python.dist has been ported to Python 3 (#8556)\n - twisted.internet.interfaces.IOpenSSLContextFactory has been added,\n   which defines the interface provided both by the old-style\n   twisted.internet.ssl.ContextFactory class and the newer\n   twisted.interface.ssl.CertificateOptions class. This is a precursor\n   to formally deprecating the former class in favour of the latter.\n   (#8597)\n - twisted.python.zipstream has been ported to Python 3 (#8607)\n - Zip file entries returned by ChunkingZipFile.readfile() are now\n   context managers. (#8641)\n - twisted.protocols.socks has been ported to Python 3 (#8665)\n - twisted.spread.banana has been ported to Python 3 (#8667)\n - Trial can now be invoked via \"python -m twisted.trial\".

(#8726)\n - twisted.protocols.dict has been ported to Python 3 (#8732)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - pip install -e \".[dev]\" now works on Python 3, but it will not\n   install twistedchecker or pydoctor, which have not yet been ported.\n   (#7807)\n - twistd can now properly daemonize on Linux/Unix when run under\n   Python3 and will not hang indefinitely. (#8155)\n - tox can now be used to run Twisted's tests on Windows (#8578)\n - twisted.python.filepath.setContent() and\n   twisted.python.filepath.moveTo() now work on Windows with Python 3\n   (#8610)\n - twisted.internet.win32eventreactor works on Python 3 in Windows\n   (#8626)\n - The TLS payload buffer size was reduced in\n   twisted.protocols.tls.TLSMemoryBIOProtocol.  This fixes writing of\n   very long strings using the TLSv1_1 method from the OpenSSL\n   library. (#8693)\n - twisted.logger._flatten.flattenEvent() now does not crash if passed\n   a unicode string. (#8699)\n - twisted.application.strports.service (and thus twistd) no longer\n   swallow asynchronous exceptions from IStreamServerEndpoint.listen.\n   (#8710)\n - _twistd_unix now reports the name and encoded message of an\n   exception raised during daemonization on Python 2 and 3. (#8731)\n - twisted.protocols.amp now handles floats on Python 3. Previously,\n   sending a float would raise a ValueError. (#8746)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n - Some broken links to xprogramming in the unit test documentation\n   have been fixed. (#8579)\n - The Twisted Tutorial \"The Evolution of Finger\" has been updated to\n   use endpoints throughout. (#8588)\n - Updated the mail examples to use endpoints and better TLS. (#8595)\n - Changed the Twisted Web howto to use endpoints and modern TLS.\n   (#8596)\n - Updated bug report URL in man pages. (#8600)\n - In twisted.internet.udp.Port, write() takes a parameter of type\n   bytes.  This is clarified in the docstring. (#8635)\n - twisted.internet.interfaces.ITransport.write() and\n   twisted.internet.interfaces.ITransport.writeSequence() take bytes\n   parameters. (#8636)\n - twisted.python.filepath.AbstractFilePath.getContent() returns\n   bytes.  The docstring was updated to clarify this. (#8637)\n - Updated release notes to reflect that 15.4 is the last version that\n   supported Python 2.6, not 15.5. (#8651)\n - A missing space in defer.rst resulted in badly rendered output. The\n   space was added. (#8723)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - Dropped support for pyOpenSSL versions less than 16.0.0.

(#10269)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.client.getPage, twisted.web.client.downladPage, and the associated implementation classes (HTTPPageGetter, HTTPPageDownloader, HTTPClientFactory, HTTPDownloader) have been removed because they do not segregate cookies by domain. They were deprecated in Twisted 16.7.0 in favor of twisted.web.client.Agent. GHSA-92x2-jw7w-xvvx.

(#10231)\n- trial.runner.filenameToModule now sets the correct ``module.__name__`` and ``sys.modules`` key (#10230)\n- twisted.internet.process can now pause and resume producing in python 3 (#9933)\n- When installing Twisted it now requires a minimum Python 3.6.7 version to match the version used with automated testing. This is the minimum Python version that we know that Twisted works with. (#10098)\n- twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor will no longer raise a TypeError like \"SelectorEventLoop required, instead got: <uvloop.Loop ...>\" (broken since 21.2.0). (#10106)\n- twisted.web.template.flatten and flattenString will no longer raise RecursionError if a large number of synchronous Deferreds are included in a document. (#10125)\n- Fix type hint for http.Request.uri (from str to bytes). (#10139)\n- twisted.web.http_headers.getRawHeaders and twisted.web.http_headers.getAllRawHeaders are now typed to return immutable sequences of header values instead of lists.\n  twisted.web.http_headers.getRawHeaders is now typed to return a non-optional value if a non-None default value is given. (#10142)\n- Fixed type hint for addr argument to twisted.internet.interfaces.buildProtocol. (#10147)\n- twisted.trial._dist.worker.LocalWorker.connectionMade now always writes the\n  log file using UTF-8 encoding.\n  In previous versions it was using the system default encoding.\n  This was causing encoding errors as the distributed trial workers are sending\n  Unicode data and the system default encoding might not always be Unicode compatible.\n  For example, it can be CP1252 on Windows. (#10157)\n- twisted.words.protocols.irc.ctcpExtract was updated to work with PYPY 3.7.4. (#10189)\n- twisted.conch.ssh.transport.SSHServerTransport and twisted.conch.ssh.transport.SSHClientTransport no longer use the hardcoded\n  SHA1 digest for non-group key exchanges. (#10203)\n- haproxy transport wrapper now returns hosts of type str for getPeer() and getHost(), as specified by IPv4Address and IPv6Address documentation. Previously it was returning bytes for the host. (#10211)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Remove dead link in twisted.internet._dumbwin32proc module docstring (#9520)\n- Sync API docs templates with pydoctor 21.2.2 release.

(#3795)\n- twisted.web.http's chunked encoding support now rejects chunk sizes that are invalid because they look like negative hexadecimal integers. (#10130)\n- The type hint of twisted.web.server.Request.postpath is now correctly listed as Optional[List[bytes]]. This was incorrect in Twisted v21.2.0. (#10136)\n- The server-side HTTP/1.1 chunking implementation now rejects invalid chunk boundaries, preventing unbounded buffering. (#10137)\n- The server-side HTTP/1.1 chunking implementation now limits the length of the chunk size line (which includes chunk extensions) to twisted.web.http.maxChunkSizeLineLength \u2014 1 KiB \u2014 so that it may not consume an unbounded amount of memory. (#10144)\n- Calling twisted.web.server.Site now registers its expiration timeout using the reactor associated with its twisted.web.server.Site. Site now a reactor attribute via its superclass, twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory.

Also, due to\n  session-related bugs, it defaults to False. (#9583)\n- twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks and ensureDeferred will now associate a contextvars.Context with the coroutines they run, meaning that ContextVar objects will maintain their value within the same coroutine, similarly to asyncio Tasks. This functionality requires Python 3.7+, or the contextvars PyPI backport to be installed for Python 3.5-3.6. (#9719, #9826)\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.fromCoroutine has been added. This is similar to the existing ensureDeferred function, but is named more consistently inside Twisted and does not pass through Deferreds. (#9825)\n- trial now allows the @unittest.skipIf decorator to specify that an entire test class should be skipped. (#9829)\n- The twisted.python.deprecate.deprecatedKeywordParameter decorator can be used to mark a keyword paramater of a function or method as deprecated. (#9844)\n- Projects using Twisted can now perform type checking against a Twisted\n  installation, for example using mypy. (#9908)\n- twisted.python.util.InsensitiveDict now fully implements MutableMapping. (#9919)\n- Python 3.8 is now tested and supported. (#9955)\n- Support a coroutine function in twisted.internet.task.react (#9974)\n- PyPy 3.7 is now tested and supported. (#10093)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- twisted.web.twcgi.CGIProcessProtocol.processEnded(...) now handles an already-finished request, for example when request.connectionLost(...) was called previously. (#9468)\n- Twisted's dependency on PyHamcrest has been moved from the base package to the new \"test\" extra. Consequently the test extra must be installed for Twisted's test suite to pass. (#9509)\n- Fixed serialization of timedelta, date, and time objects in twisted.spread. (#9716)\n- twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor now raises an exception if instantiated with an event loop which is not compatible with asyncio.SelectorEventLoop. This fixes the AsyncioSelectorReactor in Python 3.8+ on Windows, where in bp-34687 the default Windows asyncio event loop was changed to ProactorEventLoop.  Applications that use AsyncioSelectorReactor on Windows with Python 3.8+ must call asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy()) before instantiating and running AsyncioSelectorReactor. (#9766)\n- twisted.internet.process.registerReapProcessHandler and ._BaseProcess.reapProcess will no longer raise a TypeError when processing a None PID (#9775)\n- INotify will close its file descriptor if a directory is automatically removed by twisted from the watchlist because it's deleted, avoiding orphaned filedescriptors. (#9777)\n- DelayedCall.reset() is now working properly with asyncioreactor (#9780)\n- AsyncioSelectorReactor.seconds() now correctly returns an epoch time. (#9787)\n- The _connDone parameter has been removed from twisted.internet.abstract.FileDescriptor.loseConnection()'s signature in order to match the signature in the base class twisted.internet._newtls.ConnectionMixin loseConnection(). (#9849)\n- The Gtk3 reactor now runs on Wayland-only sessions (#9904)\n- Descriptive error messages from twisted.internet.error are now present when running with 'python -OO'. (#9918)\n- Comparator methods such as __eq__() now always return NotImplemented for uncomparable types. (#9919)\n- When installing Twisted it now requires a minimum Python 3.5.4 version to match the version used with automated testing. This is the minimum Python version that we know that Twisted works with. (#10098)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- The narrative docs now contains the associated Twisted version and the date\n  when they were generated. (#3945)\n- The \"Writing a twistd plugin\" howto now explains how to deploy twistd plugins using Python packaging and pip (#9243)\n-  (#9868, #9873, #9874)\n- Fix a typo in \"Introduction to Deferreds\" document. (#9948)\n- The Twisted Coding Standard has been changed to refer to The Black code style for guidelines regarding whitespace and line lengths. (#9957)\n- Exempt ``__repr__``, ``__slots__`` and other ``@attrs.define`` related changes from compatibility policy. (#9982)\n- Fix many docstring mistakes flagged by new sanity checks in pydoctor. (#10021)\n- Fix a few dozen broken links to API documentation pages. (#10057)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.cred.credentials.UsernameHashedPassword is now deprecated because it doesn't hash the password, causing it to return the wrong result. (#8368)\n- twisted.news is now removed from the codebase. (This module was never installed on Python 3.) (#9782)\n- Support for Python 2.7 has been removed. Twisted now supports only Python versions 3.5/3.6/3.7. (#9790)\n- twisted.pair.ethernet.IEthernetProtocol.addProto()'s interface was changed to match the existing implementations in the Twisted source code. (#9877)\n- twisted.python.filepath.FilePath.statinfo was deprecated in Twisted 15.0.0 and has now been removed. (#9881)\n- The parameters to twisted.internet.base.ReactorBase.addSystemEventTrigger(), twisted.internet.base.ReactorBase.callWhenRunning(), twisted.internet.base.ReactorBase.callLater(), twisted.internet.task.Clock.callLater() have been renamed to match the parameters defined in the following interfaces: twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorCore, twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorTime. (#9897)\n- Functions and types in twisted.python.compat that existed to support the transition from Python 2 to 3 have been deprecated. (#9922)\n- twisted.logger.LoggingFile.softspace has been deprecated. (#10042)\n- twisted.python.win32.WindowsError and FakeWindowsError have been deprecated. (#10053)\n- twisted.mail.pop3client has been renamed to twisted.mail._pop3client, since it has always been a private implementation module.

This fixes \"trial -j\" on Python 3. (#9264)\n- twisted.trial.runner now uses the 'importlib' module instead of the 'imp'\n  module on Python 3+. This eliminates DeprecationWarnings caused by importing\n  'imp' on Python 3.

(#5519)\n- twisted.internet.posixbase.PosixReactorBase.adoptStreamPort and\n  twisted.internet.posixbase.PosixReactorBase.adoptStreamConnection now support\n  AF_UNIX SOCK_STREAM sockets. (#5573)\n-  (#8940)\n- t.protocol.policies.TimeoutMixin.setTimeout and\n  t.protocol.policies.TimeoutProtocol.cancelTimeout (used in\n  t.protocol.policies.TimeoutFactory) no longer raise a\n  t.internet.error.AlreadyCancelled exception when calling them for an already\n  cancelled timeout. (#9131)\n- twisted.web.template.flatten now supports coroutines that yield Deferreds.\n  (#9199)\n- twisted.web.client.HTTPConnectionPool passes the repr() of the endpoint to\n  the client protocol factory, and the protocol factory adds that to its own\n  repr(). This makes logs more useful. (#9235)\n- Python 3.6 is now supported (#9240)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- twisted.python.logfile.BaseLogFile and subclasses now always open the file in\n  binary mode, and will process text as UTF-8. (#6938)\n- The `ssl:` endpoint now accepts `certKey` PEM files without trailing\n  newlines. (#7530)\n- Logger.__init__ sets the namespace to \"<unknown>\" instead of raising KeyError\n  when unable to determine the namespace from the calling context. (#7930)\n- twisted.internet._win32serialport updated to support pySerial 3.x and dropped\n  pySerial 2.x support. (#8159)\n- twisted.python.rebuild now works on Python 3. (#8213)\n- twisted.web.server.Request.notifyFinish will now once again promptly notify\n  applications of client disconnection (assuming that the client doesn't send a\n  large amount of pipelined request data) rather than waiting for the timeout;\n  this fixes a bug introduced in Twisted 16.3.0. (#8692)\n- twisted.web.guard.HTTPAuthSessionWrapper configured with\n  DigestCredentialFactory now works on both Python 2 and 3. (#9127)\n- Detect when we\u2019re being run using \u201c-m twisted\u201d or \u201c-m twisted.trial\u201d and use\n  it to build an accurate usage message. (#9133)\n- twisted.protocols.tls.TLSMemoryBIOProtocol now allows unregisterProducer to\n  be called when no producer is registered, bringing it in line with other\n  transports. (#9156)\n- twisted.web web servers no longer print tracebacks when they timeout clients\n  that do not respond to TLS CLOSE_NOTIFY messages. (#9157)\n- twisted.mail.imap4 now works on Python 3. (#9161)\n- twisted.python.shortcut now works on Python 3 in Windows. (#9170)\n- Fix traceback forwarding with inlineCallbacks on python 3. (#9175)\n- twisted.mail.imap4.MessageSet now treats * as larger than every message ID,\n  leading to more consistent and robust behavior. (#9177)\n- The following plugins can now be used on Python 3 with twistd: dns, inetd,\n  portforward, procmon, socks, and words. (#9184)\n- twisted.internet._win32serialport now uses serial.serialutil.to_bytes() to\n  provide bytes in Python 3. (#9186)\n- twisted.internet.reactor.spawnProcess() now does not fail on Python 3 in\n  Windows if passed a bytes-encoded path argument. (#9200)\n- twisted.protocols.ident now works on Python 3. (#9221)\n- Ignore PyPy's implementation differences in base object class. (#9225)\n- twisted.python.test.test_setup now passes with setuptools 36.2.1 (#9231)\n- twisted.internet._win32serialport SerialPort._clearCommError() no longer\n  raises AttributeError (#9252)\n- twisted.trial.unittest.SynchronousTestCase and\n  twisted.trial.unittest.TestCase now always run their tearDown methods, even\n  when a test method fails with an exception. They also flush all errors logged\n  by a test method before running another, ensuring the logged errors are\n  associated with their originating test method. (#9267)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Trial's documentation now directly mentions the preferred way of running\n  Trial, via \"python -m twisted.trial\". (#9052)\n- twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint and\n  twisted.internet.endpoints.TCP4Client endpoint documentation updated to\n  correctly reflect that the timeout argument takes a float as well as an int.\n  (#9151)\n- Badges at top of README now correctly render as links to respective result\n  pages on GitHub. (#9216)\n- The example code for the trial tutorial is now compatible with Python3 and\n  the current version of Twisted. (#9223)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.protocols.dict is deprecated. (#9141)\n- gpsfix.py has been removed from the examples. It uses twisted.protocols.gps\n  which was removed in Twisted 16.5.0. (#9253)\n- oscardemo.py, which illustrates the use of twisted.words.protocols.oscar, as\n  been removed. twisted.words.protocols.oscar was removed in Twisted 17.5.0.\n  (#9255)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #5949, #8566, #8650, #8944, #9159, #9160, #9162, #9196, #9219, #9228, #9229,\n  #9230, #9247, #9248, #9249, #9251, #9254, #9262, #9276, #9308\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.conch.ssh.userauth.SSHUserAuthServer now gracefully handles\n  unsupported authentication key types. (#9139)\n- twisted.conch.client.default verifyHostKey now opens /dev/tty with no buffer\n  to be compatible with Python 3. This lets the conch cli work with Python 3.\n  (#9265)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.conch.ssh._cryptography_backports has been removed in favor of using\n  int_to_bytes() and int_from_bytes() from cryptography.utils. (#9263)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #9158, #9272\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.static.File.contentTypes is now documented. (#5739)\n- twisted.web.server.Request and any Twisted web server using it now support\n  automatic fast responses to HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 OPTIONS * requests, and\n  reject any other verb using the * URL form. (#9190)\n- --add-header \"HeaderName: Value\" can be passed to twist web in order to set\n  extra headers on all responses (#9241)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.client.HTTPClientFactory(...).gotHeaders(...) now handles a wrong\n  Set-Cookie header without a traceback. (#9136)\n- twisted.python.web.http.HTTPFactory now always opens logFile in binary mode\n  and writes access logs in UTF-8, to avoid encoding issues and newline\n  differences on Windows. (#9143)\n- The code examples in \"Using the Twisted Web Client\" now work on Python 3.\n  (#9172)\n- twisted.web.server.Request and all web servers that use it now no longer send\n  a default Content-Type header on responses that do not have a body (i.e. that\n  set Content-Length: 0 or that send a 204 status code). (#9191)\n- twisted.web.http.Request and all subclasses now correctly fire Deferreds\n  returned from notifyFinish with errbacks when errors are encountered in\n  HTTP/2 streams. (#9208)\n- twisted.web.microdom, twisted.web.domhelpers, and twisted.web.sux now work on\n  Python 3. (#9222)\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Sending a list of recipients with twisted.smtp.SenderFactory has been fixed.\n  This fixes a problem found when running buildbot. (#9180)\n- twisted.mail.imap4.IMAP4Server parses empty string literals even when they\n  are the last argument to a command, such as LOGIN. (#9207)\n\n\nWords\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.words.tap has been ported to Python 3 (#9169)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #9246\n\n\nNames\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Queries for unknown record types no longer incorrectly result in a server\n  error. (#9095)\n- Failed TCP connections for AFXR queries no longer raise an AttributeError.\n  (#9174)\n\n\nTwisted 17.5.0 (2017-06-04)\n===========================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- spawnProcess no longer opens an unwanted console on Windows (#5726)\n- The transition to the hyperlink package adds IPv6 support to\n  twisted.python.url.URL. This is now deprecated and new code should use\n  hyperlink directly (see #9126). (#8069)\n- twisted.logger now buffers only 200 events by default (reduced from 65536)\n  while waiting for observers to be configured. (#8164)\n- The transition of twisted.python.url to using the hyperlink package enables a\n  URL.click() with no arguments (or 0-length string argument) to resolve dot\n  segments in the path. (#8184)\n- twisted.protocols.finger now works on Python 3. (#8230)\n- TLS-related tests now pass when run with OpenSSL 1.1.0. This makes tests pass\n  again on macOS and Windows, as cryptography 1.8 and later include OpenSSL\n  1.1.0. (#8898)\n- UNIX socket endpoints now process all messages from recvmsg's ancillary data\n  via twisted.internet.unix.Server.doRead/twisted.internet.unix.Client.doRead,\n  while discarding and logging ones that don't contain file descriptors.\n  (#8912)\n- twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint and twisted.web.client.Agent work\n  again with reactors that do not provide IReactorPluggableNameResolver. This\n  undoes the changes that broke downstream users such as treq.testing. Note\n  that passing reactors that do not provide IReactorPluggableNameResolver to\n  either is deprecated. (#9032)\n- A Python 3 Perspective Broker server which receives a remote call with\n  keyword arguments from a Python 2 client will now decode any keys which are\n  binary to strings instead of crashing. This fixes interoperability between\n  Python 2 Buildbot clients and Python 3 Buildbot servers. (#9047)\n- twisted.internet._threadedselect now works on both Python 2 and 3. (#9053)\n- twisted.internet.interfaces.IResolverSimple implementers will now always be\n  passed bytes, properly IDNA encoded if required, on Python 2. On Python 3,\n  they will now be passed correctly IDNA-encoded Unicode forms of the domain,\n  taking advantage of the idna library from PyPI if possible. This is to avoid\n  Python's standard library (which has an out of date idna module) from mis-\n  encoding domain names when non-ASCII Unicode is passed to it. (#9137)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- The examples in Twisted howto \"Using the Twisted Application Framework\",\n  section \"Customizing twistd logging\" have been updated to use latest logging\n  modules and syntax (#9084)\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.asFuture and\n  twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.fromFuture were added, allowing for easy\n  transitions between asyncio coroutines (which await Futures) and twisted\n  coroutines (which await Deferreds). (#8748)\n- twisted.application.internet.ClientService.whenConnected now accepts an\n  argument \"failAfterFailures\". If you set this to 1, the Deferred returned by\n  whenConnected will errback when the connection attempt fails, rather than\n  retrying forever. This lets you react (probably by stopping the\n  ClientService) to connection errors that are likely to be persistent, such as\n  using the wrong hostname, or not being connected to the internet at all.\n  (#9116)\n- twisted.protocols.tls.TLSMemoryBIOProtocol and anything that uses it\n  indirectly including the TLS client and server endpoints now enables TLS 1.3\n  cipher suites. (#9128)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #8133, #8995, #8997, #9003, #9015, #9021, #9026, #9027, #9049, #9057, #9062,\n  #9065, #9069, #9070, #9072, #9074, #9075, #9111, #9117, #9140, #9144, #9145\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.runner.inetdconf.InvalidRPCServicesConfError,\n  twisted.runner.inetdconf.RPCServicesConf, twisted.runner.inetdtap.RPCServer,\n  and twisted.runner.portmap, deprecated since 16.2.0, have been removed.\n  (#8464)\n- twisted.python.url and twisted.python._url were modified to rely on\n  hyperlink, a new package based on the Twisted URL implementation. Hyperlink\n  adds support for IPv6 (fixing #8069), correct username/password encoding,\n  better scheme/netloc inference, improved URL.click() behavior (fixing #8184),\n  and more. For full docs see hyperlink.readthedocs.io and the CHANGELOG in the\n  hyperlink GitHub repo. (#9126)\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- History-aware terminal protocols like twisted.conch.manhole.Manhole no longer\n  raise a TypeError when a user visits a partial line they added to the command\n  line history by pressing up arrow before return. (#9031)\n- The telnet_echo.tac example had conflicting port callouts between runtime and\n  documentation. File was altered to run on documented port, 6023. (#9055)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Remove diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 from twisted.conch. See https://weakdh.org/\n  (#9019)\n- Removed small and obscure elliptic curves from conch. The only curves conch\n  supports now are the ones also supported by OpenSSH. (#9088)\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.mail.smtp has been ported to Python 3. (#8770)\n\n\nNames\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- RRHeader now converts its ttl argument to an integer, raising a TypeError if\n  it cannot. (#8340)\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.cgi now works on Python 3 (#8009)\n- twisted.web.distrib now works on Python 3 (#8010)\n- twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory now propagates its reactor's callLater method to\n  the HTTPChannel object, rather than having callLater grab the global reactor.\n  This prevents the possibility of HTTPFactory logging using one reactor, but\n  HTTPChannel running timeouts on another. (#8904)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.template.flattenString docstring now correctly references\n  io.BytesIO (rather than NativeStringIO). (#9028)\n\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.client now exposes the RequestGenerationFailed exception type.\n  (#5310)\n- twisted.web.client.Agent will now parse responses that begin with a status\n  line that is missing a phrase. (#7673)\n- twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel and twisted.web._http2.H2Connection have been\n  enhanced so that after they time out they wait a small amount of time to\n  allow the connection to close gracefully and, if it does not, they forcibly\n  close it to avoid allowing malicious clients to forcibly keep the connection\n  open.

(#9024)\n\n\nTwisted Core 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - Added a new interface,\n   twisted.internet.interfaces.IHostnameResolver, which is an\n   improvement to twisted.internet.interfaces.IResolverSimple that\n   supports resolving multiple addresses as well as resolving IPv6\n   addresses.  This is a native, asynchronous, Twisted analogue to\n   getaddrinfo. (#4362)\n - twisted.web.client.Agent now uses HostnameEndpoint internally; as a\n   consequence, it now supports IPv6, as well as making connections\n   faster and more reliably to hosts that have more than one DNS name.\n   (#6712)\n - twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions now has the new constructor\n   argument 'raiseMinimumTo', allowing you to increase the minimum TLS\n   version to this version or Twisted's default, whichever is higher.\n   The additional new constructor arguments 'lowerMaximumSecurityTo'\n   and 'insecurelyLowerMinimumTo' allow finer grained control over\n   negotiated versions that don't honour Twisted's defaults, for\n   working around broken peers, at the cost of reducing the security\n   of the TLS it will negotiate. (#6800)\n - twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions now sets the OpenSSL\n   context's mode to MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS, which will free the\n   read/write buffers on idle TLS connections to save memory. (#8247)\n - trial --help-reactors will only list reactors which can be\n   imported.  (#8745)\n - twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint now uses the passed\n   reactor's implementation of\n   twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorPluggableResolver to resolve\n   hostnames rather than its own deferToThread/getaddrinfo wrapper;\n   this makes its hostname resolution pluggable via a public API.\n   (#8922)\n - twisted.internet.reactor.spawnProcess now does not emit a\n   deprecation warning on Unicode arguments. It will encode Unicode\n   arguments down to bytes using the filesystem encoding on UNIX and\n   Python 2 on Windows, and pass Unicode through unchanged on Python 3\n   on Windows. (#8941)\n - twisted.trial._dist.test.test_distreporter now works on Python 3.\n   (#8943)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - trial --help-reactors will now display iocp and win32er reactors\n   with Python 3. (#8745)\n - twisted.logger._flatten.flattenEvent now handles log_format being\n   None instead of assuming the value is always a string. (#8860)\n - twisted.protocol.ftp is now Python 3 compatible (#8865)\n - twisted.names.client.Resolver can now resolve names with IPv6 DNS\n   servers. (#8877)\n - twisted.application.internet.ClientService now waits for existing\n   connections to disconnect before trying to connect again when\n   restarting. (#8899)\n - twisted.internet.unix.Server.doRead and\n   twisted.internet.unix.Client.doRead no longer fail if recvmsg's\n   ancillary data contains more than one file descriptor. (#8911)\n - twist on Python 3 now correctly prints the help text when given no\n   plugin to run. (#8918)\n - twisted.python.sendmsg.sendmsg no longer segfaults on Linux +\n   Python 2. (#8969)\n - IHandshakeListener providers connected via SSL4ClientEndpoint will\n   now have their handshakeCompleted methods called. (#8973)\n - The twist script now respects the --reactor option. (#8983)\n - Fix crash when using SynchronousTestCase with Warning object which\n   does not store a string as its first argument (like\n   libmysqlclient). (#9005)\n - twisted.python.compat.execfile() does not open files with the\n   deprecated 'U' flag on Python 3. (#9012)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOption's 'method' constructor\n   argument is now deprecated, in favour of the new 'raiseMinimumTo',\n   'lowerMaximumSecurityTo', and 'insecurelyLowerMinimumTo' arguments.\n   (#6800)\n - twisted.protocols.telnet (not to be confused with the supported\n   twisted.conch.telnet), deprecated since Twisted 2.5, has been\n   removed. (#8925)\n - twisted.application.strports.parse, as well as the deprecated\n   default arguments in strports.service/listen, deprecated since\n   Twisted 10.2, has been removed. (#8926)\n - twisted.web.client.getPage and twisted.web.client.downloadPage have\n   been deprecated in favour of https://pypi.org/project/treq and\n   twisted.web.client.Agent.

(#8920)\n\n\nTwisted Names 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n=================================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.names.authority.BindAuthority has been ported to Python 3.\n   (#8880)\n\n\nTwisted News 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Pair 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Runner 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n==================================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - On Python 3, procmon now handles process output without exceptions\n   (#8919)\n\n\nTwisted Web 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n===============================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - twisted.web.client.Agent now sets ``Content-Length: 0`` for PUT and\n   POST requests made without a body producer. (#8984)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory now times connections out after one\n   minute of no data from the client being received, before the\n   request is complete, rather than twelve hours. (#3746)\n - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel, the server class for Twisted's\n   HTTP/1.1 server, now exerts backpressure against clients that do\n   not read responses. This means that if a client stops reading from\n   a socket for long enough, Twisted will stop reading further\n   requests from that client until it consumes some responses. (#8868)\n - twisted.web.http_headers.Headers.getRawHeaders no longer attempts\n   to decode the default value when called with a unicode header name.\n   (#8974)\n - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel is less likely to leak file\n   descriptors when timing out clients using HTTPS connections. In\n   some cases it is still possible to leak a file descriptor when\n   timing out HTTP clients: further patches will address this issue.\n   (#8992)\n\nOther\n-----\n - #7744, #8909, #8935\n\n\nTwisted Words 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n=================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Core 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - The twist script can now be run by invoking python -m twisted.\n   (#8657)\n - twisted.protocols.sip has been ported to Python 3. (#8669)\n - twisted.persisted.dirdbm has been ported to Python 3.

(#8861)\n - The IOCP reactor no longer transmits the contents of uninitialized\n   memory when writing large amounts of data. (#8870)\n - Deferreds awaited/yielded from in a\n   twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred wrapped coroutine will now\n   properly raise exceptions. Additionally, it more closely models\n   asyncio.ensure_future and will pass through Deferreds. (#8878)\n - Deferreds that are paused or chained on other Deferreds will now\n   return a result when yielded/awaited in a twisted.internet.defer\n   .ensureDeferred-wrapped coroutine, instead of returning the\n   Deferred it was chained to. (#8890)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n - twisted.test.proto_helpers is now explicitly covered by the\n   compatibility policy.

(#8681)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.web.Agent now tolerates receiving unexpected status codes\n   in the 100 range by discarding them, which is what RFC 7231\n   recommends doing. (#8885)\n - twisted.web._http.H2Stream's getHost and getPeer implementations\n   now actually return the host and peer instead of None. (#8893)\n\n\nTwisted Words 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n=================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - twisted.words.protocols.irc has been ported to Python 3 (#6320)\n\n\nTwisted Core 16.5.0 (2016-10-28)\n================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - Added twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.addTimeout method to enable\n   timeouts of deferreds. (#5786)\n - Perspective Broker (the twisted.spread package) has been ported to\n   Python 3 (#7598)\n - 'yield from' can now be used on Deferreds inside generators, when\n   the generator is wrapped with\n   twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred. (#8087)\n - twisted.internet.asyncioreactor has been added, which is a Twisted\n   reactor on top of Python 3.4+'s native asyncio reactor. It can be\n   selected by passing \"--reactor=asyncio\" to Twisted tools (twistd,\n   Trial, etc) on platforms that support it (Python 3.4+). (#8367)\n - twisted.python.zippath now works on Windows with Python 3. (#8747)\n - twisted.internet.cfreactor is ported to Python 3 and supported on\n   2.7 and 3.5+.

This prevents process-related tests from hanging on\n   Windows with Python 3. (#8735)\n - Client and server TLS connections made via the client TLS endpoint\n   and the server SSL endpoint, as well as any other code that uses\n   twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions, no longer accept 3DES-\n   based cipher suites by default, to defend against SWEET32. (#8781)\n - twisted.logger.jsonFileLogObserver no longer emits non-JSON\n   tracebacks into its file; additionally,\n   twisted.logger.formatEventAsClassicLogText now includes traceback\n   information for the log event it formats. (#8858)\n - twisted.python.version now exports a version of Incremental that is\n   16.10.1 or higher, making t.p.v.Version package name comparisons\n   case-insensitive. (#8863)\n - twisted.python.reflect.safe_str encodes unicode as ascii with\n   backslashreplace error handling on Python 2. (#8864)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n - The twisted.internet.interfaces.IProtocol.dataReceived() method\n   takes one parameter of type bytes.  This has been clarified in the\n   doc string. (#8763)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - twisted.python.constants is deprecated in preference to constantly\n   on PyPI, which is the same code rolled into its own package.\n   (#7351)\n - twisted.python.dist3 has been made private API. (#8761)\n - When the source code is checked out, bin/trial is no longer in the\n   tree.  Developers working on the Twisted source code itself should\n   either (1) run all tests under tox, or (2) run 'python setup.py\n   develop' to install trial before running any tests. (#8765)\n - twisted.protocols.gps, deprecated since Twisted 15.2, has been\n   removed.

Add twisted.application.runner API,\n   currently private, which twist is built on. (#5705)\n - The new interface IHandshakeListener that can be implemented by any\n   Protocol provides a callback that is called when the TLS handshake\n   has been completed, allowing Protocols to make decisions about the\n   TLS configuration before application data is sent. (#6024)\n - twisted.python.syslog has been ported to Python 3. (#7957)\n - twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred has been added, similar to\n   asyncio's ensure_future. Wrapping a coroutine (the result of a\n   function defined using async def, available only on Python 3.5+)\n   with it allows you to use the \"await\" keyword with Deferreds inside\n   the coroutine, similar to \"yield\" when using inlineCallbacks.\n   (#8088)\n - twisted.internet.inotify have been ported to Python 3 (#8211)\n - twisted.enterprise has been ported to Python 3. The third-party\n   pysqlite2 package has not been ported to Python 3, so any database\n   connector based on pysqlite2 cannot be used. Instead the sqlite3\n   module included with Python 3 should be used. (#8303)\n - Scripts such as cftp, ckeygen, conch, mailmail, pyhtmlizer,\n   tkconch, twistd and trial have been updated to be setuptools\n   console scripts.  (#8491)\n - twisted.pair.raw and twisted.pair.rawudp have been ported to Python\n   3 (#8545)\n - twisted.internet.baseprocess has been ported to Python 3. (#8546)\n - twisted.python.dist has been ported to Python 3 (#8556)\n - twisted.internet.interfaces.IOpenSSLContextFactory has been added,\n   which defines the interface provided both by the old-style\n   twisted.internet.ssl.ContextFactory class and the newer\n   twisted.interface.ssl.CertificateOptions class. This is a precursor\n   to formally deprecating the former class in favour of the latter.\n   (#8597)\n - twisted.python.zipstream has been ported to Python 3 (#8607)\n - Zip file entries returned by ChunkingZipFile.readfile() are now\n   context managers. (#8641)\n - twisted.protocols.socks has been ported to Python 3 (#8665)\n - twisted.spread.banana has been ported to Python 3 (#8667)\n - Trial can now be invoked via \"python -m twisted.trial\".

(#8726)\n - twisted.protocols.dict has been ported to Python 3 (#8732)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - pip install -e \".[dev]\" now works on Python 3, but it will not\n   install twistedchecker or pydoctor, which have not yet been ported.\n   (#7807)\n - twistd can now properly daemonize on Linux/Unix when run under\n   Python3 and will not hang indefinitely. (#8155)\n - tox can now be used to run Twisted's tests on Windows (#8578)\n - twisted.python.filepath.setContent() and\n   twisted.python.filepath.moveTo() now work on Windows with Python 3\n   (#8610)\n - twisted.internet.win32eventreactor works on Python 3 in Windows\n   (#8626)\n - The TLS payload buffer size was reduced in\n   twisted.protocols.tls.TLSMemoryBIOProtocol.  This fixes writing of\n   very long strings using the TLSv1_1 method from the OpenSSL\n   library. (#8693)\n - twisted.logger._flatten.flattenEvent() now does not crash if passed\n   a unicode string. (#8699)\n - twisted.application.strports.service (and thus twistd) no longer\n   swallow asynchronous exceptions from IStreamServerEndpoint.listen.\n   (#8710)\n - _twistd_unix now reports the name and encoded message of an\n   exception raised during daemonization on Python 2 and 3. (#8731)\n - twisted.protocols.amp now handles floats on Python 3. Previously,\n   sending a float would raise a ValueError. (#8746)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n - Some broken links to xprogramming in the unit test documentation\n   have been fixed. (#8579)\n - The Twisted Tutorial \"The Evolution of Finger\" has been updated to\n   use endpoints throughout. (#8588)\n - Updated the mail examples to use endpoints and better TLS. (#8595)\n - Changed the Twisted Web howto to use endpoints and modern TLS.\n   (#8596)\n - Updated bug report URL in man pages. (#8600)\n - In twisted.internet.udp.Port, write() takes a parameter of type\n   bytes.  This is clarified in the docstring. (#8635)\n - twisted.internet.interfaces.ITransport.write() and\n   twisted.internet.interfaces.ITransport.writeSequence() take bytes\n   parameters. (#8636)\n - twisted.python.filepath.AbstractFilePath.getContent() returns\n   bytes.  The docstring was updated to clarify this. (#8637)\n - Updated release notes to reflect that 15.4 is the last version that\n   supported Python 2.6, not 15.5. (#8651)\n - A missing space in defer.rst resulted in badly rendered output. The\n   space was added. (#8723)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - Dropped support for pyOpenSSL versions less than 16.0.0.
