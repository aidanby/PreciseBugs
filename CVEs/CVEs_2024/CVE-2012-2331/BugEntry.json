(garvinhicking)\n\n    * Add new links to check for upgradable SPARTACUS plugins\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Add new frontend view \"Archive by Authors\": /archive/Axx.html to\n      view the archive listing for specific authors only (like viewing\n      archive by specific categories only via /archive/Cxx.html etc.)\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Templating: Add new {$entry.html_title} variable that holds\n      unescaped HTML code of the Entry's title (garvinhicking)\n\n    * BC-Break / Plugin API change: The serendipity_getTemplate() file\n      now no longer returns FALSE when a file is not found, but instead\n      the filename without a path. This is required so that the smarty-\n      created error message contains the missing filename instead of an\n      empty '' string.\n      Plugins based on this function need to make sure that they will\n      now properly use a file_exists() check on the returned function,\n      if they want to probe different locations of a file.\n      All template files containing the string \"plugin\" will still return\n      FALSE for the function call, to circumvent problems with spartacus\n      plugins.\n      Bottom line: Plugins that use \"*plugin*.tpl\" filenames or check\n      via file_exists() on the returned variable are safe.\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Added arabic (sa) language by Way\n\n    * Add patch to allow entryproperties plugin to define passwords for\n      specific entries (Falk D\u00f6ring)\n\n    * Made smarty function \"serendipity_printComments\" accept to new\n      parameters: \"order\" (ASC/DESC) and \"limit\" (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Comment moderation panel, usability improvement: Blocking authors/\n      URLs will lead to the originating page.

(garvinhicking)\n\n   * RSS feeds use the permalink URL to link to extended entry, not the\n     RSS guid element.

(garvinhicking)\n\n   * Optionally allow using a local PEAR installation. Set\n     $serendipity['use_PEAR'] = true\n     in your serendipity_config_local.inc.php or serendipity_config.inc.php\n     file.

Major thanks to\n      Matthew Groeninger.\n\n    * Enhanced nl2br plugin so that it will NOT put breaks into pre-\n      defined tags like <pre>, <code> etc. Not enabled by default.\n      Thanks to Brendon K from the forums!\n\n    * Portuguese translation update by Angel\n\n    * Added functionality to reply to comments in the admin interface\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Enhance spamblock plugin with session hash check, to prevent\n      automatted comment posting.

(garvinhicking)\n\nVersion 1.1-beta5 (October 18th, 2006)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Added new plugin hooks:\n        backend_templates_configuration_top\n        backend_templates_configuration_bottom\n        backend_templates_configuration_none\n      for the theme configuration (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Allow to set $serendipity['CacheControl'] to make serendipity emit\n      Cache-Control: HTTP headers. Thanks to annonymous from the forums!\n\n    * Use seperate PHP session ID when using HTTPS login. Set 'secure'\n      cookie parameters when using HTTPS. Thanks to lynoure!\n\n    * Added possibility for templates to define the sidebars they use.\n      The template specifies this via the $template_config array in\n      the config.inc.php file of a template. It looks like this:\n       $template_config = array(\n         array(\n           'var'     => 'sidebars',\n           'title'   => 'Sidebars',\n           'type'    => 'string',\n           'default' => 'left,hide,right'\n         )\n       );\n      Note some things: Seperate the sidebar keys with a \",\" only -\n      do not use spaces. Also never use more than 6 characters for\n      the descriptors.\n      If you do not want to make it configurable, you can also use\n      the $serendipity['sidebars'] array to define the sidebars\n      that are available.\n\n    * Made category-recursion show orphaned categories because of\n      permission restrictions (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Fix some markup functions in textile plugin (Matthias Leisi)\n\n    * Add Smarty function to show commentform (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Group management now allows to disallow certain plugins or even\n      specific plugin hooks per usergroup (garvinhicking)\n\nVersion 1.1-beta3 ()\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Change permalinks to allow \"%\" in URLS. Fix templatedropdown\n      plugin to remove double \"//\". Fix bad htmlspecialchars of the\n      RDF ident link. (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Allow to apply current permissions of a directory to all sub-\n      directories (Matthew Groeninger)\n\n    * Fix a bug in the HTTP 304 Conditional GET RSS-Feed caching when\n      the server timezone offset was not set to zero. Thanks to dand!\n\n    * Added ability to use HTTP Authentication to the blog. Can be\n      triggered by submitting HTTP Auth credentials [only supported when\n      the server runs with mod_php, not as CGI]. Authentication can be\n      forced URLs with the \"?http_auth=true\" parameter, which\n      will then send a \"401 Unauthorized\" header.\n      If your server does not support mod_php, you can submit REQUEST\n      variables: ?http_auth_user=XXX&http_auth_pw=YYY.\n      Note that specifying username and password in the URI will lead\n      to password disclosure in HTTP logfiles.\n      This feature is most importantly meant for RSS-feeds, to make\n      RSS readers able to submit login credentials. (garvinhicking)\n\nVersion 1.1-beta1 (August 14th, 2006)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Fix multiple loading of $serendipity['smarty'] theme options when\n      calling serendipity_smarty_init() more than once. Many thanks to\n      Sven Ediger for reporting this. (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Properly sort media directories (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Better use of \"return by references\" in some vital areas.\n      Improves performance. Might introduce glitches. Keep an eye on this!\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Add new template 'comments_by_author' which show comments made\n      by authors. New permalink structure:\n       \"/comments/[AUTHORNAME]/comments|trackbacks|comments_and_trackbacks/P[PAGENUMBER]/FROM [YYYY-MM-DD]/TO [YYYY-MM-DD]\"\n      Instead of /FROM and /TO you can also use /F and /T.\n      Instead of /FROM and /TO you can also specify /last_X, where X\n      is the amount of past days to show comments for.\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Add \"Comments and Trackbacks\" feed feature (stm99..)\n\n    * Add LiveJournal XML importer (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Fix not fetching allow_comments/moderate_comments value when\n      inside search function. Thanks to stm! (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Add new links to check for upgradable SPARTACUS plugins\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Add new frontend view \"Archive by Authors\": /archive/Axx.html to\n      view the archive listing for specific authors only (like viewing\n      archive by specific categories only via /archive/Cxx.html etc.)\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Templating: Add new {$entry.html_title} variable that holds\n      unescaped HTML code of the Entry's title (garvinhicking)\n\n    * BC-Break / Plugin API change: The serendipity_getTemplate() file\n      now no longer returns FALSE when a file is not found, but instead\n      the filename without a path. This is required so that the smarty-\n      created error message contains the missing filename instead of an\n      empty '' string.\n      Plugins based on this function need to make sure that they will\n      now properly use a file_exists() check on the returned function,\n      if they want to probe different locations of a file.\n      All template files containing the string \"plugin\" will still return\n      FALSE for the function call, to circumvent problems with spartacus\n      plugins.\n      Bottom line: Plugins that use \"*plugin*.tpl\" filenames or check\n      via file_exists() on the returned variable are safe.\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Added arabic (sa) language by Way\n\n    * Add patch to allow entryproperties plugin to define passwords for\n      specific entries (Falk D\u00f6ring)\n\n    * Made smarty function \"serendipity_printComments\" accept to new\n      parameters: \"order\" (ASC/DESC) and \"limit\" (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Comment moderation panel, usability improvement: Blocking authors/\n      URLs will lead to the originating page. Thanks to Tanel Raja!\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Patch mb-functions to better work on foreign/japanese charsets\n      (thanks to deminy!)\n\n    * Replaced core smarty assign() calls to assign_by_ref() where\n      appropriate. (Falk D\u00f6ring, garvinhicking)\n      TODO: This might introduce oddities! Check thoroughly.\n\n    * Fixed not showing entries in the quicksearch that have the\n      \"no frontpage\" entryproperty set (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Fixed sidebar category plugin to show proper category listing\n      for permission-based restrictions, when \"current autho\" mode\n      is selected (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Added experimental XML-engine, for XSLT templating support\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Added experimental PHP-engine templating support, bypassing\n      Smarty. Work in progress, mostly proof-of-concept. Might\n      be changed completely. Read instructions in the\n      include/template_api.inc.php file. Dedicated to Davey. ;)\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Support to crop images from within the media database. Pick a\n      picture in the MDB, go to the property section of that image\n      and click on the \"EDIT\" link.

(garvinhicking)\n\nVersion 1.1-alpha6()\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Use possibly existing local PEAR by default. Patch by Davey\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Add missing indices for the statistics visitor DB tables\n      (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Add new \"custom\" property bag type, which can emit any kind of\n      custom HTML/JS values. Current property bag value can be referenced\n      by DOM GetElementById('config_plugin_XXX') if you want to emit\n      specific JavaScript. Can also be used by template configurator for\n      heavily customized output. (garvinhicking)\n\n    * Fix bug #1494653: Non-Unique index constraint for 'exits' table.\n      Thanks to Markus Brueckner! (garvinhicking)\n\nVersion 1.1-alpha5()\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   * Implemented Drag and Drop based plugin configuration panel for\n     re-ordering plugin layout.

Many thanks to Yasuo Ohgaki for giving\n     a helping hand! (garvinhicking)\n\n   * Added possibility to hide/temporarily disable Event plugins\n     (garvinhicking)\n\n   * Added \"plugin_api_extension\" class, which contains some helper\n     methods for future use, like re-ordering DB items or checking\n     valid emails. (Falk D\u00f6ring)\n\n   * Fix multiple occurences of the string \"--\" in the entry title to\n     not mess up HTML display because of weird Firefox interpretation\n     (Bug #1474290) (garvinhicking)\n\n   * Made \"fullfeed\" syndication option also support \"let the client\n     decide\", via $_GET['fullFeed'] = true/false. (garvinhicking)\n\n   * Added new configuration option to that lets you toggle whether to\n     comply with RFC2616 on Conditional GET. (Garvinhicking)\n\n   * Support template/theme/style-specific options via \"config.inc.php\"\n     file in template directory.
