This is already the case for win32.\n-bug: A bug when more than one data source was created using the same data input source with multiple outputs has been fixed.\n-feature: The default install/upgrade screen has been revised.\n\n0.6.6\n-feature: Multiple data sources per .rrd is supported. To use this feature, simply create a data input source with multiple outputs that 'Update RRA'.\n-feature: Graph item grouping, which enables you to delete/reorder groups of similair graph items.\n-feature: Graph preview and output preview in the console, which allows you to preview what a graph will look like/what rrdtool's output is.\n-feature: Graph-based permissions have added, you can also show/hide certain hierarchies per user.\n-feature: Multiple data source per .rrd file support, read the docs for more information.\n-feature: You can now export graphs to static png's/html's every n times.\n-feature: By default, SNMP data source names come from <IP>_<IFNUM>, instead of just <IFDESC> which is more unique.\n-feature: More options for users such as where to go when the user logs in and whether the user can have their own settings or not.\n\n0.6.5\n-bug: Fixed some of the data source naming issues. You can now use any data source name you want; cacti will take care of making the name \"rrdtool friendly\".\n-feature: Cacti will use PHP's builtin SNMP support if detected, SNMP is overall faster now too. NOTE: PHP's SNMP support may not work with all of your MIB names, you may have to use the OID instead!\n-feature: Basic high speed counter support has been added, use 'hcin'/'hcout' to use it. Also may not work with PHP's builtin SNMP support yet.\n-bug: Using the MAX consolidation function with graph data works better now. You can make graphs that look like the MRTG ones (5 minute maximum). This code still needs a little work though.\n\n0.6.4\n-bug: You can now add the same CDEF to multiple data sources in the same graph.\n-feature: Ability to \"sync\" changes with the .rrd file with rrdtool's TUNE function. Cacti also tries to fill in internal data source path and name information to keep graphs from \"breaking\" when possible.\n-settings: You can now change the PHP Binary path from within cacti.\n-feature: Cacti can now export static images/html files when it gathers data like MRTG did.\n-feature: Multiple graph hierarchies are supported.\n-feature: You can now \"zoom in\" on any portion of the graph hierarchy by clicking on a header item.\n-bug: Some changes were made to make cacti more win32 complaint; a tutorial on how to setup cacti on win32 can be found on the raXnet page.\n-feature: You can now create all graphs for an SNMP host with one click.\n-feature: You can customize the graph title when creating graphs using the 'Make Graph' or 'Make All Graphs' link.\n-feature: Data sources in cacti are no longer limited to 19 characters. If you create a data source name that rrdtool will not like, cacti will automatically modify the name and save it internally for rrdtool-only use.\n\n0.6.3\n-feature: Put limits (HTML 'maxlength') on fields that have a maximum length.\n-feature: Added 'cacti Settings' and 'User Administration' to the cacti menu.\n-feature: Added a 'Step' field for Data Sources to graph data at non-300 second intervals.\n-feature: Added a '--rigid' on/off option, plus the ability to choose between '--alt-autoscale' and '--alt-autoscale-max' when using auto scale.\n-feature: Added a 'Base Value' field to the graphs to adjust how the vertical axis is displayed.\n-feature: Updated the menu/header graphics for a smoother look and easier navigation.\n-feature: cacti now stores its settings in the database instead of config.php, so they can be manipulated under 'cacti Settings'. Database credentials are still located in config.php however.\n-feature: Added a preview of the rrdtool source when creating data sources.\n-feature: Added a \"data source duplicate\" function and moved \"graph duplicate\" to \"Graphs\" on the cacti menu.\n-settings: You can now turn on/off cacti's builtin authentication.\n-settings: You can control what is logged (create, graph, snmp, update).\n-feature: Added a \"Total All Data Sources\" CDEF, which can be used to represent the total of all of the data on a graph.\n-bug: Fixed a few add/edit/delete form-related bugs.\n-docs: Added some more content to the documentation and made it more visible from within cacti.\n\n0.6.2\n-bug: Fixed some bugs when creating CDEF's using multiple data sources.\n-bug: Fixed more SNMP parsing bugs with some versions of net-snmp.\n-feature: added an \"auto-refresh\" feature to the graphs (thanks Nossie).\n-bug: HRULE's and VRULE's acually work now.\n-docs: the beginnings of some real documentation.\n-bug: you can select the color black now.\n\n0.6.1\n-bug: Fixed a parsing bug with snmp, more parsing is done in cacti's code and not via arguments passed to snmpget.\n-auth: Updated the function used to hash passwords (more compatible with older MySQL versions), more strict on document caching.\n-feature: Easier installation: cacti now checks for common problems and gives suggestions. Database updates are also done at this time.\n-bug: Fixed a problem with adding new data input sources.\n-bug: Problem saving the wrong numbers for 'Round Robin Archives'.\n-feature: Ability to preview the output of the cron script from a web browser under 'Cron Printout'.\n-feature: Added 'Logout User' to the menu.\n-bug: Removed some occurances of /var/www/html and replaced them with more dynamic variables.\n\n0.6\n-new tree code\n-some html table issues in graph view mode\n-fixed the settings code for saved graph-view data\n\n0.5\n-initial release\n", "<?php\n/*\n +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n | Copyright (C) 2004-2018 The Cacti Group                                 |\n |                                                                         |\n | This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or           |\n | modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License             |\n | as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2          |\n | of the License, or (at your option) any later version.                  |\n |                                                                         |\n | This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,         |\n | but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of          |\n | MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You can now use any data source name you want; cacti will take care of making the name \"rrdtool friendly\".\n-feature: Cacti will use PHP's builtin SNMP support if detected, SNMP is overall faster now too. NOTE: PHP's SNMP support may not work with all of your MIB names, you may have to use the OID instead!\n-feature: Basic high speed counter support has been added, use 'hcin'/'hcout' to use it. Also may not work with PHP's builtin SNMP support yet.\n-bug: Using the MAX consolidation function with graph data works better now. You can make graphs that look like the MRTG ones (5 minute maximum). This code still needs a little work though.\n\n0.6.4\n-bug: You can now add the same CDEF to multiple data sources in the same graph.\n-feature: Ability to \"sync\" changes with the .rrd file with rrdtool's TUNE function. Cacti also tries to fill in internal data source path and name information to keep graphs from \"breaking\" when possible.\n-settings: You can now change the PHP Binary path from within cacti.\n-feature: Cacti can now export static images/html files when it gathers data like MRTG did.\n-feature: Multiple graph hierarchies are supported.\n-feature: You can now \"zoom in\" on any portion of the graph hierarchy by clicking on a header item.\n-bug: Some changes were made to make cacti more win32 complaint; a tutorial on how to setup cacti on win32 can be found on the raXnet page.\n-feature: You can now create all graphs for an SNMP host with one click.\n-feature: You can customize the graph title when creating graphs using the 'Make Graph' or 'Make All Graphs' link.\n-feature: Data sources in cacti are no longer limited to 19 characters. If you create a data source name that rrdtool will not like, cacti will automatically modify the name and save it internally for rrdtool-only use.\n\n0.6.3\n-feature: Put limits (HTML 'maxlength') on fields that have a maximum length.\n-feature: Added 'cacti Settings' and 'User Administration' to the cacti menu.\n-feature: Added a 'Step' field for Data Sources to graph data at non-300 second intervals.\n-feature: Added a '--rigid' on/off option, plus the ability to choose between '--alt-autoscale' and '--alt-autoscale-max' when using auto scale.\n-feature: Added a 'Base Value' field to the graphs to adjust how the vertical axis is displayed.\n-feature: Updated the menu/header graphics for a smoother look and easier navigation.\n-feature: cacti now stores its settings in the database instead of config.php, so they can be manipulated under 'cacti Settings'. Database credentials are still located in config.php however.\n-feature: Added a preview of the rrdtool source when creating data sources.\n-feature: Added a \"data source duplicate\" function and moved \"graph duplicate\" to \"Graphs\" on the cacti menu.\n-settings: You can now turn on/off cacti's builtin authentication.\n-settings: You can control what is logged (create, graph, snmp, update).\n-feature: Added a \"Total All Data Sources\" CDEF, which can be used to represent the total of all of the data on a graph.\n-bug: Fixed a few add/edit/delete form-related bugs.\n-docs: Added some more content to the documentation and made it more visible from within cacti.\n\n0.6.2\n-bug: Fixed some bugs when creating CDEF's using multiple data sources.\n-bug: Fixed more SNMP parsing bugs with some versions of net-snmp.\n-feature: added an \"auto-refresh\" feature to the graphs (thanks Nossie).\n-bug: HRULE's and VRULE's acually work now.\n-docs: the beginnings of some real documentation.\n-bug: you can select the color black now.\n\n0.6.1\n-bug: Fixed a parsing bug with snmp, more parsing is done in cacti's code and not via arguments passed to snmpget.\n-auth: Updated the function used to hash passwords (more compatible with older MySQL versions), more strict on document caching.\n-feature: Easier installation: cacti now checks for common problems and gives suggestions. Database updates are also done at this time.\n-bug: Fixed a problem with adding new data input sources.\n-bug: Problem saving the wrong numbers for 'Round Robin Archives'.\n-feature: Ability to preview the output of the cron script from a web browser under 'Cron Printout'.\n-feature: Added 'Logout User' to the menu.\n-bug: Removed some occurances of /var/www/html and replaced them with more dynamic variables.\n\n0.6\n-new tree code\n-some html table issues in graph view mode\n-fixed the settings code for saved graph-view data\n\n0.5\n-initial release\n", "<?php\n/*\n +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n | Copyright (C) 2004-2018 The Cacti Group                                 |\n |                                                                         |\n | This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or           |\n | modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License             |\n | as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2          |\n | of the License, or (at your option) any later version.                  |\n |                                                                         |\n | This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,         |\n | but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of          |\n | MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
