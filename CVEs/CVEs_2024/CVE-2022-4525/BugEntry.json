Users can change their data user type per agreement if needed\n    - Attestation Type:\n      - `none`, `checkbox`, `signature`\n      - Legal documents that require no attestation simply store that the user\n        has viewed the agreement at a certain timestamp\n      -

Legal documents that require a signature require that the user signs\n        attesting that they have read, answered truthfully and to the best of\n        their knowledge, and agree to the legal document\n        - Users who can't sign can have a Duly Authorized Representative sign\n          on their behalf for these types of legal documents\n      - All three types of legal documents track when a user has attested by\n        either submitting, checking, or signing the agreement\n    - Approval Process:\n      - `immediate` and `committee`\n      - Legal documents that have an immediate approval process simply require\n        the data user to complete and submit the agreement\n      - Immediate approval agreements can still have time limits placed on the\n        duration of the agreement after which a renewal is required\n      - Legal documents that require committee approval get sent to the\n        organization committee for review\n      - An organization primary reviewer can approve these agreements, or ask\n        users to make changes and resubmit\n    - Legal documents that require no attestation or checkbox attestation and\n      have and immediate approval process can be filled out directly using the\n      NSRR downloader\n    - For the NSRR downloader, checkbox attestation is replaced by typing \"Yes\"\n      or \"No\" instead of checking a checkbox\n  - Legal documents consist of one or more pages with content and data collected\n    from data users\n  - Legal documents can also contain optional riders and supporting\n    documentation uploads\n  - Organization editors can create and modify legal documents and assign them\n    to one or more datasets\n  - Multiple legal documents can be assigned to datasets to cover the different\n    commerical/noncommercial and individual/organization user types\n  - Legal documents are versioned when they are published, and subsequent\n    changes to the agreements only affect new users\n- **Profile Changes**\n  -

`both`, `commerical`, and `noncommercial`\n      - Users are asked whether they are commercial or noncommercial unless\n        `both` is selected, and this is saved on the per-user level\n      - Users can change their commercial type per agreement if needed\n    - Data User Type:\n      - `both`, `individual`, `organization`\n      - Individuals vs organizations may be required to specify different types\n        of data in agreements\n      - Similar to \"Commerical Type\", users are asked if they are entering an\n        agreement as an individual as an organization, and this setting is also\n        saved for future agreements\n      - Users can change their data user type per agreement if needed\n    - Attestation Type:\n      - `none`, `checkbox`, `signature`\n      - Legal documents that require no attestation simply store that the user\n        has viewed the agreement at a certain timestamp\n      - Legal documents that require a checkbox explicitly ask the user to check\n        a checkbox to attest that they have read, answered truthfully and to the\n        best of their knowledge, and agree to the legal document\n      - Legal documents that require a signature require that the user signs\n        attesting that they have read, answered truthfully and to the best of\n        their knowledge, and agree to the legal document\n        - Users who can't sign can have a Duly Authorized Representative sign\n          on their behalf for these types of legal documents\n      - All three types of legal documents track when a user has attested by\n        either submitting, checking, or signing the agreement\n    - Approval Process:\n      - `immediate` and `committee`\n      - Legal documents that have an immediate approval process simply require\n        the data user to complete and submit the agreement\n      - Immediate approval agreements can still have time limits placed on the\n        duration of the agreement after which a renewal is required\n      - Legal documents that require committee approval get sent to the\n        organization committee for review\n      - An organization primary reviewer can approve these agreements, or ask\n        users to make changes and resubmit\n    - Legal documents that require no attestation or checkbox attestation and\n      have and immediate approval process can be filled out directly using the\n      NSRR downloader\n    - For the NSRR downloader, checkbox attestation is replaced by typing \"Yes\"\n      or \"No\" instead of checking a checkbox\n  - Legal documents consist of one or more pages with content and data collected\n    from data users\n  - Legal documents can also contain optional riders and supporting\n    documentation uploads\n  - Organization editors can create and modify legal documents and assign them\n    to one or more datasets\n  - Multiple legal documents can be assigned to datasets to cover the different\n    commerical/noncommercial and individual/organization user types\n  - Legal documents are versioned when they are published, and subsequent\n    changes to the agreements only affect new users\n- **Profile Changes**\n  -

Dataset files are indexed to improve viewing folders with 1,000 or more\n      files\n  - **Collection**\n    - Users can search across multiple datasets that have an associated data\n      dictionary\n      - [Spout](https://github.com/nsrr/spout) helps format and maintain\n        JSON data dictionaries\n      - An example data dictionary is the\n        [We Care Data Dictionary](https://github.com/nsrr/wecare-data-dictionary)\n      - Variables with pre-computed charts now display the chart in the\n        collection viewer\n      - Users can create lists of variables on the collection viewer\n      - Variable charts are loaded when the image is placed in the web browser\n        viewport\n- **Tool Changes**\n  - Tools can be added and documented\n\n## 0.0.0 (October 21, 2013)\n\n- Initial prototype of the National Sleep Research Resource splash page\n- Skeleton files to initialize Rails application with testing framework and\n  continuous integration\n- Added the We Care Dataset to prototype bulk file downloads\n- Added Windows and macOS/Linux instructions for installing GNU Wget\n", "!!!\n%html{ lang: \"en\" }\n  %head\n    %meta{ charset: \"utf-8\" }\n    %meta{ content: \"IE=Edge,chrome=1\", http: { equiv: \"X-UA-Compatible\" } }\n    %meta{ name: \"viewport\", content: \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no\" }\n    = render \"layouts/meta/general\"\n    = render \"layouts/meta/facebook\"\n    = render \"layouts/meta/google\"\n    -# Don't cache any pages\n    %meta{ name: \"turbolinks-cache-control\", content: \"no-cache\" }\n    %title= [@title, ENV[\"website_name\"]].compact.join(\" -
